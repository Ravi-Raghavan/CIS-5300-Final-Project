# Description
This simple baseline model is a majority-class classifier that ignores all text features and relies only on the distribution of labels in the training set. During training, it looks at the training labels and identifies the single most frequent class in the train set between 0 (non-hate) and 1 (hate) Once this majority label is determined, the model predicts that same majority-class label for every example it would see on new unseen test data. Because it does not analyze the content of the text or learn any linguistic patterns, this baseline sets the minimum performance threshold we should exceed with more complex models like BERT. It acts as a naive benchmark to show the performance on class-imbalanced training data and whether BERT will learn meaningful patterns from features in the text to exceed this.
