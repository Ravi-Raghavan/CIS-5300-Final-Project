The images
As I have stated long ago, this article has a couple of image problems. Many have been uploaded on commons with an antiquated and questionable PD rationale, and are likely to get deleted in the near future. What's more, the image in the infobox comes to us from the self-published book of a Holocaust denier - although it was uploaded, I presume, in good-faith - who cannot claim PD for the images, but (as he does) only for the text. I presume the PD release for the text is there to help him popularize such nonsense (""""read me, copy me""""), but the images are still copyrighted by their original authors, from whom the author took his images without proper credit. Unless I see some serious arguments as to why to keep the images, sometime in the near future, I myself will visit wikicommons with a couple of deletion requests. (The only reason why, in an earlier version, this article was introduced by the Antonescu-Ribbentrop photo is that it is the only such portrait yet that is clearly released into the public domain.)

Hello user at address 90.184.243.14,

Hmmm... I don’t really agree with your comments.  I guess the disagreement boils down to what we think that Wikipedia stands for.

I was under the impression that one of the aims of Wikipedia was that it allowed information to be distributed freely worldwide and not to be controlled by commercialist corporations.  You clearly disagree with this perception.  

I take your point that the H-K adsorption isotherm isn't as popular as Langmuir & BET but the equation is peer reviewed and used by a number of research groups.  Taking the info off the adsorption website would consign this peer reviewed equation to books and journals that people would have to pay to access.  

I see this action as being very much against the Wikipedia ethos and think that the text should be reinstated immediately.

Moreover, if possible I think that people should be encouraged to add other “lower status” equations to the webpage so that as much information as possible is disseminated free of charge.    

Regarding the text being written in a journal style format: does it really matter as long as it communicates the workings of the equation?"

Many people subscribe to different beliefs than their faith. Many people do not understand what the doctrine of their faith even is, to be frank. About half of all Pentecostals, for example, do not subscribe to the biblical literalism that their church official subscribes to. Surveys show that even about 10% of Catholics subscribe to biblical literalism (see level of support for evolution), even if their faith officially does not. In fact, many Catholics are surprised to find out that the curia and Pope etc have issued repeated statements supporting evolution to various degrees for about 100 years. If a person wants to defend biblical literalism, depending on exactly how one interprets """"literalism"""", it can result in an attack on evolution, which is sometimes perceived as a challenge. This is coupled with some of the apparent incredible statements of evolution; for example that we all share a lot of features with the genetic code of other living things, and that our ancesters were likely to be microbes in a primordial soup. I do not think this has to be too complicated, and does not even have to mention what denomination the person is from to any great extent, since this is more of an individual thing. It just has to be pointed out that the reason that people are attacking evolution is that they perceive it as being in conflict with a literal interpretation of the bible, and that would undermine all kinds of other beliefs they hold.

 Edison Movie reference - 1940 

I just heard a bug reference in the movie - Edison, The Man (1940) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison,_The_Man - towards the end of the movie when Edison determines that his two dynamos have a problem because the speed governors were not synced until he mechanically linked them. 

His first erroneous attempt caused the dynamos to act as a motor/generator combo until the governors were mechanically linked. He wanted the dynamos to work as parallel generators. In the movie, Spencer Tracy distinctly used the term """"bugs"""" for this problem when he first attempted to light up New York City.

Granted, this is a movie. But the term """"bug"""" was obviously used during Edison's invention period for mechanical design issues that needed to be resolved and thus included in the movie. Re-quoting the previous Edison quote - [""""Bugs"""" — as such little faults and difficulties are called]. And the movie itself is from 1940, which is earlier than when it was first used for software. It seems likely that """"bugs"""" was an engineering term before it made it into software."""

In light of the above discussions, and the fact that the list is too inclusive to be useful (or unbiased), I propose that a very narrow definition of terrorism be used for this list.

0,"First off, we are not discussing 2015, we are discussing 2016; that much should be obvious. Second, the fact that we've always done things a certain way does not erase the possibility of improving our process. I would argue, and I'd hope you would agree, that these articles have only gotten better over time. That improvement did not happen because we sat on our hands and were content with the level of quality we had already reached. Third, I do not think Lotus/Renault and Marussia/Manor are relevant situations to each other. With Lotus, we know the Renault takeover is going to be done, and we know the name will be changed. Both have been confirmed. With Marussia, as F1 fans we know the name was only kept to keep their FOM TV rights money, and we have every reason to believe it will be changed now that Marussia is entirely out of the picture, but that's nonetheless original research that isn't fit for this article. I now agree that I was wrong to fight for the Renault name, but Lotus is equally wrong. We have no specific confirmation of the former, but we do have confirmation that it won't be the latter. So what we know for sure is very little - in fact, I believe all we know is the drivers and the engine. That that's why it should say TBA-Lotus. Additionally, think of it from this perspective: a person reads a news article announcing that the Renault takeover has been completed. They read another story from the head of Renault Sport indicating the Lotus team name will be dropped. These articles are from reliable sources and feature direct quotes. They then come here and see...Lotus. Their only reaction is going to be that Wikipedia is clearly wrong. And they're right to think that. And if you DON'T agree that reliably reported quotes from the head of organizations are good enough sources for Wikipedia, then there's quite a lot that needs to be removed from this article. You can't have it both ways."

 Maba Diakhou Bâ 

I first came across the Maba Diakhou Bâ article when I was looking for articles relating to Senegambia.  Having read the view history section of the article, it was evident that it has been on display for quite a few years now.

The purpose of starting this discussion is to disagree with several aspects of the historical account being presented in the Maba Diakhou Bâ article, based on reliable secondary sources as stated in the notablity policy.  Although I have primary documents about the man Maba Diakhou Bâ, I will stick to secondary sources in line with Wiki's policy.  Before I start to put forward my counter argument, I think a brief history is necessary for those who are not well familiar with the subject.  

Maba was a Senegambian jihadist in the 19th century who spent years launching wars against non-Muslim Kingdoms in order to convert them to Islam.  As it will become clearer , you will find out that converting people to Islam was not his only objective for launching jihad.  In any case, he was partly responsible for the mass conversion of the Senegambian people particularly the Wolof people and other tribes in the 19th century.  This is very significant, because Senegambia which encompasses Senegal and The Gambia are predominantly Muslim countries.  The Muslim population are the descendants of those converted in masses in the 19th century many of whom by Maba Diakhou Bâ.  Islam being very strong in both Senegal and The Gambia especially with the advent of the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal, Maba Diakhou Bâ is given a saint like figure in both Senegal and The Gambia.  As such, no one dares to comment on the atrocities of Maba, his back handed dealings with the French and British administration during the colonial era, his enslavement of people whom he viewed as non-Muslims, his pillaging of lands etc.  Instead, the Muslim majority of Senegambia led by the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal have fabricated his historical account and pass it off as facts that some historians have fallen for, but of course there are others who will not be duped and have examined the true facts and written it accordingly.  It is very important to point out here that, not all ordinary Senegambian Muslims feel this way.  Many of them try to go about their daily lives with little thought for these kind of things.  There are of course others who take the words of their religious leaders as scripture that is infallible even if ample evidence is presented to them.  In most cases, when I talk about the Senegambian Muslim masses, I am referring to the Senegambian Muslim establishment, who mingle in politics, control what historical or religious programmes are presented in the media etc.  These are the ones who control information and whose desire to is release the type of information they want others to know and believe.   Having said all that, I now address each of the inaccurate accounts presented in Maba's article.  

Maba was killed on the 18th July 1867 at the Battle of Fandane Thiouthiogne commonly known in Senegambian history as
The Battle of Somb. He was killed by the Serer people led by their King Buur Sine Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof when he thought he could go and launch his jihad against the Serer people as he had done with other non-Muslim tribes and kingdoms.  (Sources: Histoire du Sine-Saloum  by Alioune Sarr, and Essai sur l’histoire du Saloum et du rip by Abdou Bouri Bâ)

The article did not give us the exact date he died and in the """"Death and legacy"""" heading, made a transitional error as to the year he died by putting """"1876"""" instead of """"1867"""". I will also address that section of the article later especially in relation to the first paragraph

In the first paragraph of this article, it says and I quote """"He became leader Almamy in Saloum"""" and under the """"Resistance and Conquest"""" heading,  (in other words resisting French colonialism as noted in the first paragraph of that heading) it states and I quote 
""""While he eventually succeeded in overtaking the dynasty of Saloum, his movement never succeeded in Sine, (Kingdom of Sine) and much of Serer territory remained animist or Christian into the 20th century.""""

First of all, Maba was nothing more than an Almamy in rebellion.  He was not a King with all the powers of a King and him overthrowing the Serer Dynasty of Saloum has not been accurately narrated in this article which I will delve in later.  Note also that in the last paragraph of the first heading, the article talks about how Maba founded Nioro du Rip, but it did not tell us in any part of the article how he founded it, just like in the whole article, important pieces of information has been"

 :: But yet, it cannot be denied that the new site is not as important, if not more, than the old site in the context of an encyclopedic article about AutoHotkey. ahkscript.org is an alternative site to autohotkey.com and is anything but a """"fan"""" site. Currently, plans are in motion to transfer ownership of autohotkey.com to the newly created AutoHotkey Foundation LLC and that at some point in time the two websites will be officially consolidated under the domain autohotkey.com, but until that changeover happens (which will likely take quite a while) it is important that the Wikipedia page remain accurate. It's also worth mentioning that nobody owns the name AutoHotkey. Hence, ahkscript.org should be listed on the Wikipedia page as an alternative site. 

 :: Also, for those of you calling ahkscript.org a """"fork"""" of autohotkey.com, the members of the community are one and the same on each site (with exceptions obviously, such as people who have been long absent) and many are active on each site, so even though it might technically be a """"fork"""", I wouldn't call it that. Instead, ahkscript.org was simply a way to ensure that AutoHotkey doesn't simply disappear from the internet one day and to provide a reliable place where the community could be active without censorship. And although the current build of AutoHotkey was once a fork of the original creator's version of AutoHotkey, the two branches have since been consolidated, the """"fork"""" declared the official version, and development on the original version has ceased completely (even for bug fixes) (this happened four of five years ago).

 Blossomland 

Any good references to use for the """"Blossomland"""" name? I thought that the one I provided (http://www.hartfordmichigan.com/hartfordhistory/Precious%20Pearls/Blossom%20Song.htm) didn't use synthesis - selected quotes:

""""That the Michigan Blossom Week song, extolling the beauties of blossom land, which was broadcasted from three Chicago radio stations and from Berrien Springs and was sung at the blossom pageant at Benton Harbor last week, was written by a Hartford woman was not known to many local people who 'listened in.'"""" (Hartford is in Van Buren County, listed as in Michiana; Benton Harbor and Berrien Springs are in Berrien, also listed)

""""Music for the song was written by Mrs. Nate Simpson of Keeler"""" (also in Van Buren County)

[lyrics] """"Oh! it's blossom time in Michigan...I can feel the lake breeze blowing"""" Lake Michigan is not specified, but it's the only logical lake in this context - lake breezes/microclimate is only a characteristic of the largest bodies of water, and the largest in the area is Lake Michigan.

I'm not sure if I can find another source with as much detail (I was hoping that there'd be something in the history section of the Blossomtime Festival website, but no mention), but the term definitely has been perpetuated in the area and is part of its identity (note Google search), so it seems notable.

The Liberties of the Subject

By WERTHER

The overwhelming balance of recorded history has been marked by despotism. When homo sapiens sapiens transitioned from hunter gatherer to agriculturalist, he gained literacy, solid dwellings, and other accoutrements of what is commonly considered civilization. But he experienced a sharp decline in personal liberty.

The reasons for this are commonsensical. Disputes between tribes of hunter gatherers could be resolved by one or the other simply pulling up stakes and relocating to a new territory, there being few material impedimenta to prevent them. A settled agricultural existence, on the other hand, implied permanent villages, granaries, and land boundaries to be defended against depredation. The need for defenses implied a national security state. Agricultural surpluses not only necessitated armed defense, but allowed a division of labor leading to policemen, soldiers, bureaucrats, and tax assessors, the latter of whom would confiscate a percentage of the harvest.

The evolution of labor conditions also implied a different mental outlook. The hunter gatherer was an independent contractor (if not brigand) who ranged over extensive territory and worked alone or in small groups. The agricultural laborer, by contrast, toiled in one spot, making his comings and goings more subject to regulation.

If the land was not his, he became dependent on the Big Man's favor. Given the increased population densities in regions where agricultural societies developed, he could only rarely strike out on his own: the good land had been already taken, and game animals cleared or hunted to local extinction. [1]

With the rise of what Karl Wittfogel call """"hydraulic civilization,"""" [2] the screw of oppression turned once again against personal liberty. In order to build the extensive earthworks necessary for the state to survive the next drought or flood, the rulers of these proto-superpowers subjected their subjects to enforced toil and off-duty regimentation which rendered them no more free than so many draft animals.

It is unlikely the rulers of the states in the Valley of Mexico, the Nile, the Euphrates, the Ganges, or the Yang-Tze had much toleration for the complaints their subjects, who were enslaved, enserfed, or otherwise regimented for the greater good as defined by the states' rulers. These complaints, had they been permitted, would have constituted freedom of speech.

Nor would the rulers have given credence to a peasant's assertion that the interior of his crude dwelling, and the contents thereof, were inviolate from the inquisitiveness of the state. He, the peasant, simply had no rights a ruler was bound to respect (to paraphrase what a former Supreme Court Justice once said about slaves in a famous ruling in 1857); the only limit on a ruler's power over his subjects was the former's fear of rebellion should discontent overflow.

Of the two rights discussed thus far, freedom of speech and freedom from arbitrary search and seizure, the latter is fundamentally more important to human beings' maintaining a status above that of mere hive animals. This is not intended in any way to disparage the desirability and necessity of free speech. But there are practical circumstances when free speech is not exercised by reasonable peopledue to reticence, shame, or its merely being not worth the effort. Or when one is married.

Much obnoxious and exhibitionistic behavior is rationalized as free speech, while more urgent matters are suppressed: how many hourly employees feel free to say what they really think of their supervisors, and is the resultant lawsuit really covered by the First Amendment? But asinine reality TV blares on. Out of politeness or discretion, most intelligent people censor their opinions about politics, in-laws, bosses, and religion when they are in the public commons.

The inviolability of one's person, and one's dwelling, is more basic. What would the average person resent more: being told he cannot ask questions of the President of the United States at a staged event, or being ordered to be strip searched in public? Or, for that matter, have his house ransacked? That is the principle at issue. The lesser freedom is essential for political discourse, the greater freedom distinguishes us from dogs. [3]

Respect for privacy, for oneself and one's fellow citizens, is the benchmark of a sense of an individual self. The majority of psychologically well adjusted people believes that there are facts and circumstances about them that just do not bear the glaring searchlight of public revelation. Some things are simpl"

Oh and great video That was amazing I can't wait to read it finished linger yesterday. Was sad that part of the book was over and now there is only one book holding me to grace and Sam. I want to read it quick as a flash but I also never want to read it so I can keep guessing whats going to happen. This is the first book that I have read that has that effect. I cried at the end of linger and shiver and I'm defiantly going to cry at the end of forever. Maybe not because it's sad but that now Sam and grace are gone Looove your cast. Before I watched I was think Emma Watson would be amazing!!! I love all the characters i tryed singing it but i cant its too fast lol Love it . I think they would make a better couple.

What's this ``Right now you have a block of 7 days`` stuff, as if you are informing me of someone else's actions?  You blocked me.  Just say soespecially if you are going to twiddle with your user name so that what I see in the notice is something different from what I see in my block log.  I almost mistook you for some well-intentioned soul who thought that he was going to offer to help out in some unspecified way in my reeducation.  Some helpful, innocent bystander with a ``Help!`` button in his signature for some reason or anther.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:To say that one cannot raise an issue and claim, on a forum for making such complaints about the actions of editors such as WP:ANI, that an editor's actions have been rude and inconsiderate (or even aggressive, your word, if I had said that), is ludicrous.  It is totally contrary to all sense of fairness and due process, on Wikipedia or anywhere else. Raising such an issue is clearly not a violation of WP:CIVIL, whether or not in your subjective opinion  you can find some excuse for that actionbut you haven't even bothered to try to do that.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:But you also seem to have entirely missed the point of the issue I raised at WP:ANI.  Rlevse's actions in disrupting the process are not wrong becasue he was incidentally rude and inconsiderate to me in doing so; they are wrong because they are bad for Wikipedia.  They are wrong because they corrupt the process of the various dispute resolution network we have.  They would have been wrong if he had been pleasant and nice to me and had tried to discuss things with me and actually accomplish something, rather than blocking me out of the blue.  The fact that he was rude and inconsiderate is irrelevant to that issue.  I even pointed that out there, and don't understand how you could have missed that.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:You are instead assuming bad faith on my part, in addition to not paying any attention to the actual issues raised there.  You have turned a blind eye to the issue that was raised, just because, for whatever reasonand I don't have a clue what it isyou have taken a dislike to me. Not a good foundation for any discussion.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:But then, you aren't really interested in discussion, are you?  No more so than Rlevse.  No, in fact, much less sohe didn't block me to keep me from responding to anything he had said. He merely didn't say anything, anywhere. You, OTOH, have blocked me specifically to stop me from addressing your response or anyone else's on the WP:ANI discussion, and the subsequent one on WP:AN.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The disruption of WQA was done to give an advantage in content disputes to , who had already had a Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts on his own actions at Kilogram, filed by  in [this back on 1 September, before I ever got involved in that discussion there.

Although I normally prefer to answer a message on the page where it was posted, on this occasion it seems to me that it will be more helpful if the information I give you is on your talk page for future reference, so I am copying your message to here, and replying here.     Please note that we are from digital agency and Stayfree India given us instruction to create the page for the stayfreewomenforindia and it is not for the promotion of the product but it is for the good cause of the women in  India . I really don't know who on the Stayfree page in the wiki , the wiki user is promotion. We can send you the content for the approval . It is genuine and original content for the periods , how to cure on those days . We would like to make awareness to women to use sanitary pads because it is very safe for the health.   Please let us know how we can add the content for women care in wiki . If you need we can use the J&J; official id for this page . Hope to get the positive answer from your end  — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •     :Clearly you are acting in good faith, attempting to serve a useful purpose in informing people of information that stands to benefit their health. Unfortunately, however, this is an example of exactly the kind of thing which Wikipedia does not do, and it conflicts with several of Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. You are clearly intending to use Wikipedia to host a page about a product to publicise it. Whether the motivation behind doing this is to increase profits of the company making that product or ``for the good cause of the women in India`` is irrelevant: Wikipedia is not for use to promote anything for any purpose. To put the same thing another way, the policy that Wikipedia is not for promotion applies just as much to promotion of good causes as it does to promotion of business interests. Trying to increase awareness of health issues in a population where there is widespread ignorance of those issues is no doubt a worthwhile thing to do, but it is not one of the things that Wikipedia does.  :You should also be aware that editing on behalf of a business or organisation to write about a subject in which that business or organisation has a direct interest is brings you into conflict with Wikipedia's conflict of interest guidelines. A Wikipedia article needs to be written from a neutral point of view, and if you are writing on behalf of someone else in order to publicise a subject they are involved with, it is likely that you will find it difficult or impossible to write from such a neutral point of view. (In fact, in this case it is clear that you do not even wish to write from a neutral point of view, since your declared aim is to portray the campaign as a good thing.)  :``Stayfree India`` has used several Wikipedia accounts, which have been blocked from editing, because their only purpose was using Wikipedia to promote their cause. They have evidently approached you to edit on their behalf, to continue the attempt to promote their cause. Under Wikipedia's policy on  abuse of multiple accounts, if any account is used to make edits on behalf of a blocked editor, thereby helping the blocked editor to evade the block, the account used for such purposes can be blocked too, as it is being used to circumvent Wikipedia's policies. As I said at the beginning of this message, I have no doubt that you are acting in good faith, and that is why I have taken the time and trouble to explain to you what the issues are, rather than simply blocking your account. You are welcome to contribute to Wikipedia on other topics, where you do not have a conflict of interest, would not be helping to evade blocks on other accounts, and would not be promoting a cause. However, continuing to edit in ways which conflicts with Wikipedia's policies in those respects will not be acceptable.   `"

According to Jimbo Wales, ``what is commonly called 'anonymous' editing is not particularly anonymous ... and there are good reasons to want vandals on ip numbers instead of accounts.`` While about 97% of vandalism comes from anonymous users, about  or 82% of anonymous edits are intended to improve the encyclopedia.

Mario Party 4 is the fourth in a series of board game style video games for Nintendo platforms, featuring popular Nintendo characters. It was released on the Nintendo GameCube in North America on October 21, 2002 strangely before the Japanese release on November 8, 2002. It was released on November 29, 2002 in Europe, being heavily criticised for being 'Nintendo's big GameCube Game' for Christmas 2002 as Metroid Prime was delayed until March 2003.

Mario Party 4 was the first Mario Party that was released on the Nintendo GameCube. Each board had its own host, including Toad, Goomba, Shy Guy, Koopa, and Boo. Mario Party 4 also contains some characters new to the franchise; Thwomp and Whomp. Klepto, Dolphin, Lakitu, and Star, along with two completely new characters named Genie of the Lamp and Ztar, are included as well. Mario Party 4 retains the Story Mode found in Mario Party 3.

The game, as usual, contains a standard party mode in which up to four players play through a board, trying to collect as many Stars as possible. The Star Space would appear randomly on the board, and players would have to reach it before anyone else. However, the Stars carry a price tag of 20 coins, and player has to earn those coins by winning minigames, which take place at the end of each turn (after all the players have rolled the Dice Block, which will always roll a number from one to ten).

Battle minigames are like the 4-player games, but generally (with many exceptions) a little more elaborate. Battle games are usually tense because every player has to put a certain number of coins (from 5 - 50) into a pot. First place gets 70% of the pot, second place gets 30%, and a random player gets any coins lost in rounding. 

Every Mario Party contains 60 to 80 minigames of a few different types. Four-player games are a free-for-all in which all players compete against each other. 2-on-2 and 1-on-3 minigames put players in groups, so they have to cooperate in the minigame to win, even though they are against each other in the main game. In most situations, winners of these games make 10 coins each.

A new addition to the Mario Party series was the Bowser mini-games. Players play in a very elaborate mini-game that ends when one player is eliminated in various ways. (See Bowser mini-game section below) The loser loses a pre-specified item, usually coins or items.

Spaces
There is various spaces you can land in the game. The following is a list of them, and what they do.
Blue Space - You get three coins. Also, there is a special feature on this game called Hidden Blocks, in which a star or coins may be hidden on random blue spaces.
Red Space - You lose three coins.
Green Happening Space - A special board event takes place.
Warp Space - You are sent to the same space as an opponent. A spinner chooses which opponent's space you will warp to.
Mushroom Space - Two boxes will appear (one big and one small). Choose one, and you will be given either a Mini Mushroom or a Mega Mushroom. (Note: The Mega Mushroom is not always in the large box, and the Mini Mushroom is not always in the small box.)
Battle Space - A battle minigame will start in which players put a chosen amount of coins into a pot. The better you finish in the minigame, the more coins you will get back from the pot.
Bowser Space - Bowser may steal items from players or a Bowser minigame may begin.
Fortune Space - A reversal of fortune begins, in which players may have to give coins or stars to others. The player who landed"

 == Ancient Napoca and present day Cluj-Napoca == 

 """"There are no references to urban settlement on the site for the better part of a millennium thereafter"""" (Brubaker et al. 2006, p.89) (  ) 
 :A few observations: 
 :# Just because Mr. Brubaker doesn't know about any, it doesn't mean that there are none or that there won't be any ever found. I guess this topic has to be expanded anyway as it has only one view (WP:NPOV). Even if it was theoretical gap of one millennium, which to me defines logic and common sense given the city is in the middle of Europe and on the path of migrations, and there was no known asteroid, volcano eruption or ice age in that period. It was a simple conquest by others, which happen throughout the history all the time. The native population was wiped out, assimilated, enslaved, dominated (most likely in my opinion), whatever. But it doesn't make sense to assume a waste land for 1000 years, after a significant ancient history and with so many invaders. 
 :# The Dacian and Roman ruins and artifacts are in the middle of the medieval city and not 50 km away as in other situations. Even if there are speculations that the native Daco-Roman population disappeared or was wiped out by the new invaders, the new comers obviously built their """"new"""" town exactly on top of the ruined ancient city. They even probably named it after the Castrum Clus/clausa as described in the etymology, thus they insured continuity and created a clear link to the ancient city. Napoca was under new management. Why they didn't call it Napoca anymore? There are many possibilities, one being a desire to impose a new culture, to erase previous history. 
 :# Having the Napoca name appended back to Cluj, is questionable and debatable, can be deemed political or protochronistic, but at the end of the day, not entirely unfair, as the city obviously has a very significant and rich ancient history that happen exactly in the same place where the medieval Cluj was. The municipium is depicted as a major city on Tabula Peutingeriana section of Roman Dacia, on equal footing with Apula, Axiopolis, Ratiaria, Serdica and this speaks about the importance, size etc. So the ancient history part of the city deserves it equal share on an encyclopedic article like this. Cluj-Napoca is obviously not just a medieval city. 
 :# The section on ancient history also doesn't mentions the Celtic presence at all. See also Celts in Transylvania and also the National Museum of Transylvanian History. Nothing about rich archaeological finds either. A lot of content is missing and deserves its place here.

The same is true of images in many other Wikipedia articles (including this one).  If we are to disregard newspapers (because they're apt to sensationalize), and only focus on online ecyclopedia-type references, the choices are very limited.  I'm not aware that it's even possible to do an image search in Google Books.  Anyway, here are a couple more refs for you to munch on: .

 *:That is he or she thank you.    
 *:Quite the opposite. I am fully aware of what a minus sign, hyphen, endash and an emdash all are and when it is appropriate to use each one. Please point out one page that is incorrect, and if it was inadvertently put into the wrong place, move it to the right place. This is after all a collaborative encyclopedia. I can find out easily enough from the page history which one was moved. As I have said many times and will say many times again, most of the times Wikipedia """"gets it right"""". Once and a while we have an editor come along who wants to make a wp:point and we get it wrong. Usually that gets fixed in a day, week or a month, sometimes longer. This is one of those sometimes longer situations. The purpose of an encyclopedia is to inform, and not to inform incorrectly or to make up names for things, such as to pretend that an endash would be more appropriate in this case or in that case. Fortunately this is a trivial correction. There are no cases where an endash is used in a proper name. No one has found one, and until someone does, it is better to just accept that, and put that into the MOS. The MOS, though, does not determine titles, WP:TITLE does. The closest case anyone has found was a bridge, and even that turned out not to be close. Right now there is a conflict between the MOS and TITLE, and normally that is resolved by changing one to agree with the other. Since TITLE is policy and MOS is a guideline, I would expect to follow the policy every time. Normally our guidelines are well written. I can not say that for the current MOS. But that is another story.   """

0,"` :::::There is a difference between Pink Floyd the band (which this page is about) and Pink Floyd the corporation. As Far as Pink Floyd the band is concerned, Roger Waters has not been a member since 1985. A member of a band is someone who plays in the band. Further, Roger Waters has no rights to any of the new music/albums that have come out since he left. i.e. Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Division Bell. Once again showing that he is no longer a member. Finally, Pink Floyd does not need permission from Roger Waters to release albums such as Pulse. He does get paid royalties, but that is it. Further, I fail to see how you could list ``The estate of Richard Wright`` as a member of a band. Does the estate play the piano? No. It receives royalties for sure, but that doesn't make it a band member, it makes it a corporate member. I agree with Radiopathy that they should all be listed under former members. This is inline with the template on Wikipedia for musical artists. I would challenge anyone to find a Wikipedia page on a band that lists members who are no longer active as ``members`` and not ``former members``. I would also challenge you to find a band (other than the beatles, which I agree I don't like that format) that is inactive that doesn't list it's members as ``former members``. Perhaps a good comparison would be the band Genesis. On their page only Phil Collins, Tony Banks, and and Mike Rutherford are listed, even though Peter Gabriel still own rights to aspects of the band like Roger Waters does to Pink Floyd. Also, INXS does not list Michael Hutchence as a member. Why? Because he's deceased, as it clearly states on the page. I'm sure his estate receives royalty payments. I would argue that the problem we are having is that some folks are simply unwilling to acknowledge the fact that Pink Floyd exists without Roger Waters, but I could be wrong. What's frustrating is to see that this article, which was once a featured article, deviates from the norm in more than one respect in regards to this section. 1 - it lists current members of a band that is inactive (I'd be willing to have that discussion), and 2 - even if we determine that the band is active, it lists a member who is no longer playing witht the band, and a member who is deceased. Proper form would dictate that neither of these persons should be listed.  `"

0,"Yes, being paid alters judgement. So does joining Scientology, believing in Astrology, being against gun control, being for gun control, or any number of other reasons for advocacy editing. I could make a case for Wikipedia being harmed more by religious or political advocacy editing than by paid advocacy editing (but see below for why I think this might change).
There are however, a couple of things that are special about paid advocacy editing which IMO require extra care.
First, Scientology cannot do anything to suddenly have ten times more followers. They are already doing the best they can and the pool of potential converts is resistant.
Paid advocacy editing, on the other hand, can easily gain as many paid advocacy editors as desired by simply paying more. Think of the difference between getting emails advocating politics or religion vs. emails about online pharmacies. The first is annoying, but self limiting; the second gets bigger and bigger as long as it remains profitable. Our article on Email spam gives numbers like 200 billion spam messages sent per day and 97% of all emails being unwanted. I think Jimbo is right to be especially concerned over something that could grow exponentially.
Second, we really cannot do anything to convince most religion or politics advocates to change their ways other than blocking or banning them, but we can make big changes in how paid advocacy editors operate. If it becomes well known that the advocacy editors who don't edit articles directly but instead make talk page requests get better results and that the sneaky kind of paid advocacy editor usually gets reverted, the customers will naturally go with the service that gets the best results. We can make that happen, but again it takes special care."

 == Semi-protected edit request on 15 August 2015 == 

  

  
 Please excise from the Preamble heading the paragraphs I've reproduced below, in which the text of the Preamble is dissected, needlessly, and made subject to a myriad of specious editorial claims that are not and will never be substantiable, no matter how many sources one tacks on after the period. The text of the Constitution is the text of the Constitution. To assume that """"a more perfect union"""" refers back to the government under the Articles of Confederation is to take a liberty that the context doesn't allow. The phrase may be referencing England or France or the Ottoman Empire. It may be an expression of the founder's desire to create a union more perfect than all the unions that have come before and all the unions that have yet to come. Unfortunately, the Constitution doesn't explain what exactly it means by """"a more perfect union"""" and as a result neither can we. In addition to being groundless, the analysis is riddled with nonsense terms, such as """"the powers of the earth,"""" """"social contract of democratic philosophy,"""" and """"things of a general welfare."""" The final sentence of the second paragraph is plainly incoherent.  

 Ultimately, my request is that the paragraphs at issue be deleted and replaced with the text of the Preamble verbatim. 

 -""""One people"""" dissolved their connection with another, and assumed among the powers of the earth, a sovereign nation-state. The scope of the Constitution is twofold. First, """"to form a more perfect Union"""" than had previously existed in the """"perpetual Union"""" of the Articles of Confederation. Second, to """"secure the blessings of liberty"""", which were to be enjoyed by not only the first generation, but for all who came after, """"our posterity"""".[27] 

 It is an itemized social contract of democratic philosophy. It details how the more perfect union was to be carried out between the national government and the people. The people are to be provided justice, civil peace, common defense, those things of a general welfare that they could not provide themselves, and freedom. A government of """"liberty and union, now and forever"""", unfolds when """"We"""" begin and establish this Constitution.

A one-act play could be a shorter work (and often is), but in the case of Vogel's play this is not the case.  Christmas Ride is also a full-length work, running about 1:40.   Christmas Ride is thus both full-length AND one-act, much like, say, Irwin Shaw's Bury the Dead, another elegiac one-act full-length play.  Preserving this distinction is important."

I also utilized the template  (Template talk:interp for usage) to manage the interpolations in quotes, and removed part of the TMZ quote, """"and Juliet in a bikini did not disappoint."""" just my personal opinion, but I don't really think this is very relevant to the episode, though it might be better for her character article.

:

 Sandstein apparently thinks that everything not being a compliment is ipso facto derogatory. There is also another possibility that hasn't crossed his mind: neutral. No English dictionary has (derogatory) or (offensive) label next to the definition of the word nationalist. However, in Sandstein's native language the word nationalist does have a derogatory undertone. Here is the link to the definition of Nationalismus in the most authoritative German dictionary (Duden), where it has a label (meist abwertend) which translates into English as """"mostly pejoratively"""". In German it's used as a pejorative, in English it isn't and it belongs to the neutral register. I suspect that Sandstein mixed two entirely different usage contexts for otherwise related words with the same meaning, in two different languages.
 It was not my intention to make any kind of personal attack. If you look at my edit history you can see that my behavior has been nothing short of exemplary. I have never heard anyone complaining about being offended by calling them nationalist. More often than not, it is I who is on the receiving end of abuse which sometimes provokes abrasive responses. If someone said that they are offended I would've stopped.
 Sandstein's condescending comment about me apparently failing to understand something (what?), justifying the """"educational"""" component of the block by such lack of understanding is borderline insulting. Perhaps Sandstain trains his dog by taking punitive measures when puppy does something wrong, but may I remind him that we're dealing with human actors here that are not Fachidioten with blinders that only respond to Pavlovian stimuli dispensed by the master with his block^Wstick. An administrator should not be making such comments when blocking other users. They shouldn't probably be thinking of editors as offenders that ought to be subject to corrective measures (blocks) for their infractions (policy violations), but at least they could keep it to themselves.
 OK, let's say I crossed the line with nationalist name-calling. I didn't mean to use derogatorily, but I can accept that it is not an appropriate conduct. But what does that have to do with ARBMAC and the excessively long block? As I far I can see the guidelines on the WP:PA require posting a message on user's talkpage and seeking mediation. None of that happened. PA is a community-approved policy which takes precedence over anything ArbCom decides, or any admin """"broadly interprets"""". A week is something that trolls and bad-faith editors get. Surely it's too excessive?
 This whole circus is a result of content dispute with the user who submitted the enforcement request. It was not made in good faith and his ulterior goal is to remove me from editing a set of low-importance articles that are currently not in a NPOV state. He also submitted a sockpuppet investigation against me with evidence such as last-year's sarcastic comment of mine on a sister project, as well as edits that I made years ago. With all that in mind, I must say that Wikipedia community has become very effective at giving partisan editors tools to target undesirable editors - a Byzantine collection of policies which admins overzealously enforce without a second thought, and without thinking of a big picture. Admins in fact are incentivized not to involve themselves, which basically gives the enforcement gun to POV-pushers which are intimately acquainted with all the glorious details of the relevant wikilese. I urge admins to think outside the policy-enforcing request-observing mode and think whether blocking me in any way helps to resolve the pending content disputes.   """

0,"anthropomorphic bias ==  There appears to be some sensitivity with respect to this topic, which I think is due to an anthropomorphic bias.  Dysgenics is a research topic in biology; the anthropological and sociocultural aspects are not central to the topic.  The concerns listed in the heading paragraph belong lower in the text, as they apply only to the aspect of the term relating to homo sapiens.    (and I want to add)  The concept of dysgenics itself is really only at home in a discussion of genotype.  Direct anthropomorphic considerations (of the sociopolitical aspects outlined in the article) are very crude constructions which do not hew to the precise biological use of the term.  I think one danger is that, by focusing on the easily politicized extension of the term, we risk conflating an important biological concept with indirect sociological constructions.  Next thing you know, biologists innocently researching fruit flies get implicated in fascism, eugenics, and gas chambers.  So I agree that we need to make very careful use of these terms.  These concepts, while connected to a degree, should be covered carefully.     == "

 Sexual Abuse Section - Swiss Rejection of Extradition Request. 

The current information in the sexual abuse section give great detail on portions of what the Swiss said was there basis for the denial of the US request.  
However it is not at all balanced by the US perspective.  This makes it appear not NPOV in my view.  Problems include.
1.  There is a dispute of whether the documents were requested or not.
2.  It a large change from standard extradition requests, the Swiss evaluated the merits of the case, and the punishment used.  They speculated that the 42 days of evaluation could have been the entire sentence.   That speculation is defense argument for matters that have not been determined in the courts.  In this way the Swiss became a judge of the case, to which the US was not allowed to argue against.  This deviation from standard means of handling extradition requests is already being speculated to have a lasting impact on other cases.

Here are some of the concerns on the other side of what is currently written:

The Swiss government said its decision to reject extradition was partly based on U.S. authorities' failure to turn over transcripts of secret testimony given by the attorney who originally handled the director's case. The testimony """"should prove"""" that Polanski already served his sentence with the court-ordered diagnostic study, the Swiss Justice Ministry said.  

The main issue appeared to be how the Swiss government expanded its focus beyond the formalities of the American extradition request to pass judgment on allegations of misconduct by Los Angeles authorities.

""""This was an admission that when higher interests are at stake, not everyone is equal before the law,"""" wrote the widely respected Neue Zuercher Zeitung newspaper. """"Some are a bit more equal.""""

Another Zurich paper, the Tages-Anzeiger, called the Swiss decision """"shaky.""""

""""It breaks with the tradition of only examining the formal correctness of extradition requests,"""" it said. """"Perhaps the new practice will in the future also benefit detainees who have less of a lobby than the world-famous director.""""
http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hwv8qKQSMIhfdh2oT7hD0TeXDMpgD9GUC3O80

ALL of this does not explain why Polanski skipped out of his sentencing hearing, if he believed he had served his sentence, and when he quite capable lawyers representing him before the judge.

So I see the rational used by the Swiss to be controverted and biased to the defense agreements, which have never been tested before a court of law.  To where these arguments were argued, the Judges refused to grant their merit.  The method the Swiss used to determine the extradition request is entirely new.  So I believe these sentences in the section either need balancing of the two sides, and or pared down.

0,"`  == Uranium mines in Namibia ==  Hi Bine mai, namibnut again about uranium. I am slowly figuring out how things work, so apologies if this is the wrong way to address these issues. After reading about Aussinanis and writing a message to you, I clicked on the Uranium mines in Namibia link and now realize you have made all the entries there. May I point out some detail that might just be important as far as Wikipedia is concerned. There is a major distinction between a mine and an exploration project. Currently only Rössing, Langer Heinrich, Trekkopje and Husab can be called mines. Husab is in the process of construction, so one can call it a mine. Valencia is called a mine because there is a signboard on the road that says ``Valencia mine``, but they never advanced beyond the mid-exploration phase. The reality is that none of the other projects are further than advanced exploration. Even Trekkopje is technically still constructing, but have actually shut down because of the poor economy. Some of the Reptile projects (e.g. Omahola) and Zhonge Resources have received mining licences but it is unlikely that they will be developed soon; the uranium price is far too low for economical extraction and will remain like that for some time to come.   `"

i agree in many ways. personally, self-harm is at one end of a spectrum, suicide ideation at the other. self-harm is my mechanism for coping - inflicting pain on myself as a means of distracting my attention away from another type of pain - note the general idea of wanting to feel a certain type of pain over another type of pain. contrast this with episodes of suicidal ideation, when it seems that no coping mechanism can help. the goal becomes to eliminate pain (in all its forms) by terminating my life - the pain involved in the process of terminating my life becomes a consequence of the goal - note the careful planning and selection of a suicide method, driven by the general desire for a """"quick and painless"""" death."""

 Mind Pollution and Sin Star votes 

I have to take issue with your count in closing the vote on Mind Pollution. By my count there were, as you said, five votes for deletion — from myself (the nominator), BDAbramson, Mgm, KissL, and DV8 2XL — and only two votes to keep — one from Factitious, and four from sin-thetik, the article creator.

I also disagree with your count of votes for the related article, Sin Star. By my count there were five delete votes — the same five who voted to delete Mind Pollution — but you only counted four, one merge vote from Factitious, and three keep votes from sin-thetik, the article creator.

I would suggest that in the future when closing votes you check the history to determine the authorship of unsigned votes. I also think the quality and nature of the arguments presented are more important than the raw vote count. I would like to renominate these articles, but I'm not sure what the rules on that are. I guess I'll have to go read the deletion policy.

In the Sin Star article it says, """"Such promotional activities carried out by fans have gone as far as having MTV.com tricked into placing a Sin Star artist biography on their site however this was promptly removed the same day."""" It also says their debut album will come out next year, and that they don't have a label. It seems they have been more successful at defacing Wikipedia than they were at MTV.com.  """

Sjo's 'method' appears to be that (sadly) typical mentality of deleting or reverting any new editor's referenced data in a manner which wholly contradicts Wiki policies, and especially against edits that actually conform to Wiki policies.

The strap line about Wikipedia being a source that everyone can edit is becoming a pointless and hollow statement, when looking at the pattern of dictatorial and hypocritical editing policies applied by a core of prejudicial and arbitrary editors who seek to suppress any new input and then have the audacity to claim that the new editor is a troll. Sjo's arrogant reply to my question over whether  he should be reported for inconsistent application of Wiki policies sums it up.

I did find it surprising that nowhere is due process mentioned in Arbcom's procedures. There is a fourth problem that hasn't previously been mentioned which is the lack of any practicable route of appeal for Arbcom's decisions. Yes, in theory Jimbo is the final """"court of appeal"""" but that is not a route which anyone takes seriously, as far as I can tell. In practical terms the only recourse is to appeal to Arbcom itself, but how likely is it that Arbcom will admit that it's got something wrong? If Arbcom's conduct during a case has thrown due process out of the window, what is the likelihood that it will find itself at fault? Human pride and institutional defensiveness, if nothing else, will count against it. Right now, if Arbcom commits an abuse of process there is no way of correcting it other than voting out the offending arbitrators, which could take years depending in which tranche of elections they're due to come up for a vote. There is no process for anyone other than Arbcom to review cases, nor for egregious mishandling of a case to be tackled. In effect we have a single """"accountability moment"""" once a year and there is no accountability, no recourse and no effective oversight of how they have conducted themselves. What is needed, I think, is a much stricter set of rules governing what Arbcom does, combined with an independent appeals procedure that is empowered to review Arbcom's own conduct and set aside remedies if they have been passed without due process being followed.   16:11"""

Your comments on deletion review were interesting, and I rather agree.  I wonder how one could find out if the article was created, deleted, then recreated.  I have only been editing Wikipedia a few months.  I had never heard of Jim Shapiro before I ran across this article.  I was appalled when I saw it, since it appeared to be such a hit piece.  It appears that this character deserved to have his license suspended, but it doesn't appear to be appropriate for Wikipedia.  My complaint has been that there have been entirely too much lawyer-bashing in Wikipedia, usually sourcing to """"Overlawyered"""", a blatantly political site.  Speedy delete was surely appropriate as it appeared when deleted.  With the overhaul on the user's talk page, there are sources, but the article would still merit an AfD for non-notability.

Also, this is consistent with how the length contrast on the preceding vowel is marked in other surroundings (e.g. in the cited table in ``knot``).  :With regard to ``nod``, I think there is nothing wrong.

P.s, the delta function I use in the example above as  is the Kronecker delta, not the Dirac delta. The Kronecker delta is in , whereas the Dirac delta is not in L2[0,1].

Incidentally, in response to the request for examples, L2(X) is not a RKHS for X any open subset of . On the other hand, Hardy spaces usually are RKHSs, using various variants of the Szego kernel.

For example , the Hilbert space of L2 functions on the circle is not a RKHS. On the other hand, , the space of L2 functions on the circle which are tangential limits of holomorphic functions on the disc, is.  14:18"

I came after you and reverted back the false information provided by you. You gave link references and I replied to your link references in talk page that you delete and added more link which i reverted back. 

What is the point in  deleting Ramdasia Sikh Gotras and adding chamar link to it. You also did the same in Jatt and khatirs sections where you projected them too  as chamar. You say Ramdasia and Ravidasias are same which is false. You can goto the most popular Matrimonial websites -

http://shaadi.com/

http://punjabimatrimony.com/

Both have separate section for Ramdasia and Ravidasia . The Ramadsia Gotras are aslo different than Ravidasia Gotras .

Ramdasia Gotras: Nar, Badhan, Rajju, Rattu, Heer

Ravidasia Gotras: chumer,Chumber,Singhmar,Sheemar,Jassal ,Jassy Kainth.

The thing you are doing is the thing that most Ravidasias do ie; pretend to be Ramdasia and then spread false info that both are same. This can be see on matrimony websites where for eg  kainth and other listed Ravidasia castes people add themselves into Ramdasia section.

You give references to chamar books and chamar websites and no neutral source that supports your view.

The Fact Remains that  Ramdasia are weavers(Julahas) whereas Ravidasias are chamars(Leather tainers)and both are not same at all."

0,"`  Hello, thank you very much.  Yes unfortunately someone decided to go ahead and delete the page before anybody could mediate.  After 10 days the discussion was still very much active and no warning was given of deletion, or consideration of the fact that I requested mediation to resolve serious questions pertaining to bias and bad-faith.  Also, during deletion review I have shown that it is doubtful that the closing admin even read the AFD arguments properly and probably wasn't even aware that mediation had been requested.  This admin says there was clear consensus but the fact is that it was claerly shown during AFD that the advocates for deletion could not motivate their own statements, instead chosing to default anyway with ``Delete`` endorsements.  I am told that the onus of proof lies on me yet I have addressed every single criticism repeatedly whereas they could not and did not submit proof for their own statements.  Also there were many supporters who presented arguments for 'keep' (probably outweighing the number who wanted 'delete') but these arguments were never addressed and the guys at deletion review are telling me that these contributions have zero weight because the people who want to 'keep' are all first-time users.  Deletion review is also proving unhelpful and in my opinion also biased with nobody seriously considering the arguments that have been raised, or really prepared to read through the AFD discussion properly.  I have no idea of what to do next and in fact if anything can be done.  I am extremely disillusioned with this process as it is obvious that prejudgements and lots of Wiki-speak are employed to 'prove' unsuitability, rather than arguments being actually objectively considered.

Yes: in the 'Human geography' section, namely the 3rd paragraph.  Other related terms are also treated in that sxn.   | talk | 

 Central Americans are not North Americans! 

We are own people and we are not Northerners.  We are seperate from them and are nothing like them! You can try to correct me, but the people who say that we are North Americans are White folk who try to keep us down (and sometimes other ignorant groups of people).  I will never surrender to being North American and nor should any other Central American should ever buy into this.  I don't care what the White man tells us.  They're not us.  We should be able to decide for ourselves who we are and no else should tell us who to be.  This is just another way of bringing us down.  I am proud of being Central American and being someone who inhabited this land long before the White people made contact with us.  If we have been living here for the longest time, should it not be us who decides who we want to be? 

-Tito A. Martĩnez
This is a lovely essay, but unfortunately you cannot undeclare yourself a north american any more easily than you can underclare yourself an earthling.  Central America happens to be located in North America, so Central Americans are North Americans - it's a geographical thing, not a cultural thing. Perhaps you're thinking of Latin America and Anglo America?  

Actually, Tito can """"undeclare himself"""". If you'll check the Spanish Wikipedia articles on Central America and North America, you will see that Spanish language defines North America's southern-most country as Mexico. 
:es:Norteamérica redirects to es:América del Norte, which lists the lists the following political units in north to south order:
Greenland
Canada
United States
Mexico
Note that Central America is not on this list!

WilyD is also right, as far as English language goes. """"North America"""" includes Mexico and Central America. 

I think America (terminology) should provide a better explanation than it currently does. A section on English vs. Spanish terminology would help. (I don't speak Spanish, but I studied French in high school and can sometimes puzzle out the meaning. Maybe I'll recruit some bilingual Wikipedians to help me write this. -)  

Okay, but I'll claim the fatal flaw here is this:  América del Norte is a spanish term that is different from the english term North America.  Tito may not be a norteamericano - (although I don't think he declares himself here either - doesn't spanish have an equivilent to L'academie?) - but he's still north american.  

Actually, I don't think """"North American"""" is an identity that applies to Latin Americans. His country (if it's in Central America) is a part of the North American continent, but the cultural division is what he's concerned about. Want to help me update America (terminology)?  

I think America (terminology) reflects correct english usage.  Maybe Use of the word American is a better place to move these kind of complaints (although I'm actively involved in that article, and know it'll get shot down as original research).  Roughly speaking, there aren't political continents - Wikipedia has articles on Anglo America (not that I'm convinced the term exists) in contrast"

Never once did I say that ultra-Orthodox Jews have no rabbis or synagogues.

They are not clergy, in the traditional Western sense of the word. That is a fact. As for synagogues, they exist, but they are not essential. Minyan (a quorum of ten adult males in ultra-Orthodox law) is essential. You can have a minyan without a synagogue, but a synagogue without a minyan is an empty building.

If you were to draw such sharp distinctions between ultra-Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism in a recognized Judaic Studies program, they would not know what you are talking about.

C) In cases where things like hashgacha (kosher certification, etc.) are debated, you will find in most cases that it is not a question of responsa. If you know something about responsa literature in general (which apparently you do not), there are degrees of acceptance. For example, halav yisrael (milk under rabbinical supervision during milking to ensure that it comes from a cow). Most modern-Orthodox Jews do not insist on it t on the basis of a responsa by Rabbi Moshe Feinstein who determined that American government supervision is sufficient. Most ultra-Orthodox Jews do insist on it. They do not reject the responsa. In fact, Moshe Feinstein (Reb Moshe, as he was called) was considered the leading halachic authority for the American ultra-Orthodox community in the past fifty years. They will say that the ruling is right BUT they want to be machmir (more strict on themselves, meaning more pious). It is not a rejection. It is simply being stricter.

 Thankyou for you comments, but: 

  
 Hi Rosa, I'm sorry, I don't know what is meant by non-nodal phase change. 

  
 Well, you do, since I gave you several examples. 

 Here is one again: as metals are heated, they change from solid to liquid very slowly, with no boundary between the two phases. 

 Now, you can speed this up (as you noted), but the fact is that some processes in nature are non-nodal. 

 Sure, science has developed since Engels's days, but he expressed his laws in a characteristically a priori manner: 

 Hence it is impossible to alter the quality of a body without addition or subtraction of matter or motion, i.e. without quantitative alteration of the body concerned."""" 

 [I say 'characteristically' since all dialecticians do the same: i.e., they all impose their a priori schemas on to nature  the whole of Essay Two at my site is devoted to substantiating that seemingly controversial claim.] 

 And, despite the advances in science since his day, dialecticians the world over still make the same claims that Engels did. 

 So, this 'theory' is not sensitive to contrary evidence. It is held onto as a dogma. 

 I think your attempt to see Engels's hand in the development of quantum physics is fanciful, at best  at least as far as foresight is concerned.  

 Engels made so many incorrect claims about nature that by sheer luck one or two might seem to have been on the money. 

 But, this is a highly selective way of looking at science, one shared by fundamentlist christians who view the bible in the same way that dialecticiasn view their holy books. They look only for confirmation, and ignore what they do not like. 

 For example, and in this regard, quantum discontinuity might seem to validate the nodal aspect of change as underlined by Engels, but at the same time it falsifies his view of motion (which has to be continuous to generate his alleged 'contradiction'). So, when an electron, for example, moves between energy levels nodaly as you say, it is not in two places at once, and it is not in and not in one place at one and the same time. 

 Do dialecticians make a note of that? 

 No, just like Christians, they cherry pick. 

 And I think you are mistaken also in thinking I am criticising dialectics as an alternative to logic or science  it isn't. It is far too confused to be an alternative to anything. 

 So, if us Marxists needed a science (or a philosophy, or a logic), dialectics would not even make the reserve list.

In fact the satelite cities incorporate large portions of Davidson County that there is still enough room for the former City of Nashville to be corresponded by the balance. Also the drawing of the former City of Nashville wasn't quite accurate. The former city was wider and larger than the drawing. The former city incorporated almost all of Davidson County even before the formation of the controversial Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County in 1963 meaning that there was almost no unincorporated area in Davidson County.

 My two cents as food for thought, as I will most likely not participate in subsequent debates due to lack of time. First, regarding the order of the languages, it really doesn't matter which comes first (and one could argue endlessly as to why Catalan or Spanish should come first). But, I do argue for consistency, in which case, if you stick to Spanish>Catalan (or vice versa), this order should be kept throughout the article, instead of alternating. It is more encyclopedic, and less confusing. This is not an issue about neutrality. It is simply an issue of style.  

 Now, regarding """"nationality"""", I disagree with Icallbs. """"Nationality"""" does make sense in English, and it is indeed extensively used. I would advocate for its use in the introduction based on the following points: 
 * Unlike the controversial word """"nation"""", """"nationality"""" is the legal definition for Catalonia, within that same section of the Statute which does have -pardon my translation- """"judicial value"""" (valor jurídico)..  Moreover, the term, """"nationality"""" is fully constitutional and was supported by the Constitutional Court in its latest ruling. There is nothing controversial about a fully constitutional term.  
 * In English, the word """"nationality"""" does convey the same meaning as it does in Spanish. , and its used not only to refer to the Spanish nationalities, but to the nationalities within other countries as well.  
 * It has been used in non-Spanish, non-Catalan Academic literature in English to refer specifically to the nationalities of Spain (e.g. Federalism and the Balance of Power in European States (2006) from the OECD, or Institutions of Modern Spain, by the Cambridge University Press, some results amongst many that a simple query in Google Books or Google Scholar would produce, with or without quotations (i.e. the """"inverted commas"""", as they have been referred to above).  
 * The term """"nationality"""" is even used by the Encyclopedia Britannica when referring to Catalonia in the main article of Spain (requires subscription, but let me quote, just one sentence: """" [...] The three regions that had voted for a statute of autonomy in the past—Catalonia, the Basque provinces, and Galicia—were designated “historic nationalities” and permitted to attain autonomy through a rapid and simplified process. """"  

 To me, if reputable academic sources have no issues with the term """"nationality"""" (in English) and being the word chosen by the Spanish Parliament in 1978 and being a constitutional term, I don't see why we shouldn't use it. It is fully referenced in primary, secondary and tertiary sources.  

 Last but not least, other autonomous communities that usually receive less attention (for whatever reason) have used the word """"nationality"""" in their introductory paragraphs (e.g. Galicia, the Valencian Community) without any controversy. 

 Ahh, as a PS, the Constitutional Court upheld the term """"national symbols of Catalonia"""" (8th article) as fully constitutional, in the sense (I quote), """"of their condition of symbols of a nationality constituted as an autonomous community in exercise of the right acknowledged and guaranteed by the 2nd article of the Spanish Constitution [...] they are, in sum, the symbols of a nationality without any pretension [...] of contradiction to the symbols of the Spanish Nation"""". Later on, the resolution also adds that the 8th article is """"constitutional"""" (conforme a la constitución) interpreted in the sense that the said term is exclusively referring in its meaning and use, to the symbols of Catalonia """"defined as a nationality"""" and integrated into the """"indissoluble unity of the Spanish Nation"""".. Ergo I don't see a problem with using """"national symbols"""", when the term itself has been declared constitutional. But of course, you cannot avoid using this term without also making reference to the definition of Catalonia as a nationality, so we are back to square one.  

 And as a final side note (a second PS), I noted that someone said that the functions of the states of the USA and the autonomous communities in Spain are almost identical. Not true, precisely because the former is a federation and the latter is not. In a federation powers are transferred from the states to the federation and anything not explicitly transferred (i.e. collectively transferred as written in the consti"

People are being included in Jewish American categories not using the religious requirement that you have a jewish mother but regarding jewish as an ethnicity. So, even if only their father or grandfather was jewish they are being added to this category. It just seems totally non sensical to have people described as jewish american actors if they do not identify as jewish and are also of mixed ancestry like Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Michael Douglas, people like these should be in a category like Americans with Jewish ancestry to avoid these sorts of labelling problems, the same should be done for all the other ethnicity categories."

If you feel offended every single time someone is critical of Jews, such as Kevin MacDonald, you have a serious emotional problem, or, you're probably Jewish. MacDonald has himself to blame? Wrong.

That's his right to do so if he wants to and he should not get into trouble because of it, since, last I checked, the 1st amendment was still valid in America (or so they say). What next?

 Thanks for correcting the Skimboarding article to reflect the source information; much appreciated ;). 

 Feel free to drop any questions my way..  a standard welcome follows, WP:IAR is good for counterpoint: 

  
 Welcome 

 Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thank you for . I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Here are a few good links for newcomers: 

 * The five pillars of Wikipedia 
 * How to edit a page 
 * Help pages 
 * Tutorial 
 * How to write a great article 
 * Manual of Style 

 Here are some other hints and tips: 

 * I would recommend that you get a username.  You don't have to log in to read or edit articles on Wikipedia, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and there are many benefits of having a username.  (If you edit without a username, your IP address is used to identify you instead.) 
 * When using talk pages, please sign your name at the end of your messages by typing four tildes (~~~~). This will automatically produce your username (or IP address) and the date. 

 If you have any questions, check out Wikipedia:Where to ask a question, ask me on , or type  {{helpme}}  on this talk page and a user will help you as soon as possible. I will answer your questions as far as I can.  Again, welcome, and I hope you enjoy editing here and being a Wikipedian.

 Request regarding current RfAr/Clarification 

There is an open Request for Clarification regarding a sanction decided at Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Abd-William M. Connolley, see live link, or permanent link.

 is the only arbitrator to comment there so far. I agree with him, and, unless other arbitrators wish to address the issues raised, I support the close of this request with no finding or clarification. My reason for this: it is apparent that any useful clarification would require more discussion than can be accomplished at RfAr/Clarification, and that I was blocked while this request was pending, for comments made in the request itself, is an additional impediment.

There is no need for extra debate or argument. I have stated that I am willing to accept a tighter restriction than the way in which I interpreted the sanction, pending clarification by ArbComm. So the status quo is that the restriction is tight, though not necessarily as tight as defined by the administrator who blocked me. I do not consider myself restricted from what the sanction explicitly permits, and I'd argue that he did so consider. I accepted Sandstein's decision (""""clarification"""") as a neutral administrator, pending ArbComm review, not Future Perfect's who was already involved, and I had already claimed that he was involved in dispute with me.

I will continue to respect Sandstein's tightening as standing and binding on me, and will interpret this very narrowly but as originally stated, and it did permit legitimate comment before ArbComm, when I am an originating party, as is normal. Normally, I can, having filed, respond there to comments from other editors, also made there, which is what I did. ArbComm specifically allowed me to originate a case, and if I'm clearly involved as well, I see nothing in the sanction which requires me to avoid it.

I will not use this as a loophole to drive trucks through carrying my opinion about disputes between other editors, and I will avoid, in such a filing, if it happens, unnecessary mention of disputes between other editors. Obviously, if I file a case claiming involved use of tools by an admin, I will present evidence of involvement and existing disputes or other reason that recusal would have been required, which would only mention other disputes peripherally, and which will not be an attempt to resolve those other issues.

I hope that there is more clerk attention to an actual RfAr than there has been to the existing RfAr/Clarification, which, as it stands, includes an illegitimate edit by someone other than me to the material I filed. It's been pointed out by , with clerk attention requested, and nothing was done. Nevertheless, if the request is closed without action, it's moot. The real point here is that if clerks were following filings before ArbComm, surely this would have been noticed and reverted or moved, and possibly the editor warned.   """

 What 

The fuck is going on here................ I don't even know if I should bother trying to fix this or just use my second account permanently. Shit, Indrian and Times probably playing some shit game here pretending to act like me and got all this shit on my page. I knew there was something wrong with those assholes when i saw them the first time. Guess I'll have to abandon this account. Hey  you still need to learn how to read links! Don't think I forgot! This isn't funny asshole! Guess what? I have been using another account and you don't even know what it is since the very first time I was blocked! Ha, keep playing your games, you aren't preventing me from editing piece of shit. Oh and  don't think I forgot about your 5 year old temper issues when anyone tries and fixes issues with your precious Dreamcast punk ass bitch. Lol, you guys did a number on this account. Probably found out what program I was using for the first BS account you made. 

I am impressed with how much damage you have done to this account, but it really means nothing when I am still editing every day on my personal internet and you have no idea which account it is. Oh and no it's not using a proxy or a public wifi spot. Heck, I may even try reporting this, all you idiots did was use proxy's, if I post on this account on my personal connection, and THEN appeal this I might just get my account back and get you idiots banned. I know exactly what you are going to do after this to wait until I log off, and then pounce with a new account. Sadly, looking at all this crap in my talk page, an admin would have to be retarded to not see how many of these """"accounts"""" that are proxies and not actual connections. You can only hide the smell of rotten fish for awhile before someone notices.

Shit, may was well clean this shit up. 

Oh wait a second one more thing, , what kind of retarded admin are you when having a bunch of almost all accounts pretending to be me are all on proxies and not ONE of them acts like me (did you even see my history?), and not one uses a real connection? Got that brain damage you do. had to put that in bold to be clear. Warning me about an indefinite block, lol, what does that matter, you already screwed up noticing what a 5 year old would have noticed by now. Any person would be frustrated by the silliness of this nonsense. I would appeal but something tells me to much shit damage and retarded admins will make this impossible, and I would rather not use the IP of my other account (using a real connection n my personal internet) because then you guys will probably be jackass and deleted for fun, look at this page! All this shit and nothing clicked in your small head? Amazing wikipedia. 

Also I need to take note to stay away from low ranked video game pages and focus on popular until you guys get tired of the act.

Also I KNOW you guys got an account that is going to post a bit after I submit this post I SAW him and he did the EXACT same thing 3 of the duded did, you guys need help, I can't believe not one guy was not like """"this shit don't make sense"""" for a whole second. Amazing.

Alright, so clean this page and leave this message here. Erase other extra crap. Alright, looks like we are in business. BTW, I know this is probably bull, but if any of you two actually are not trolling, which is highly unlikely, than post request an admin to come by so I can clear this account up. But I have this sinking feeling you guys all knew what's been going on here this whole time, and I have no patience to search through tons of pages to find ONE contact I can talk to about this block, so you might have this account, but you won't get the other one. Suck doesn't it? Until then, I will be going about my day and you guys will most likely probably still be doing this for X amount of days cause I guess you think it's funny? Yeah.

Your method of pointing others to vast amounts of Japanese text, only a small part of which is relevant, comes across as a way of boasting how much better your Japanese language skills are. If you want to cite an article to back your views, by all means cite one that is relevant. But that link admirably demonstrates the weakness inherent in relying on a search engine.

Also, Magic should NOT be listed as a point forward.  He is a big point guard, and played as a big point guard. and guarded other point guards.    The Showtime Lakers has Michael Cooper, James Worthy, and Byron Scott starting at shooting guard and small forward, putting Magic at point guard.  Most other point forwards (particularly Pippen and anyone who would qualify in today's game) still have actual point guards on the floor with them, though the ball handling is reduced and they're often combo guards(think Ron Harper, Boobie Gibson, Delonte West).

In a unanimous result, - result is determined by judges not opinions of drunk fans. result wasnt controversial, it was unanimous. 

Davis defeated Machida via decision.[46][47] 13 of 13 ufc media outlets scored the bout in favor of Machida. - espn scored for davis. the shills listed are all ufc affiliates and have zero journalistic credentials or pretense of neutrality. 

Davis had takedowns near the end of rounds one and two, after neither fighter was able to mount any significant offense. Davis mounted significant offense, as it won him the fight. - self explanatory. davis won the fight from his offense, and in a sport, that is significant. 

ESPN scored for Davis. 

Many UFC shills with hall passes that could be taken away and votes on the ufc rankings, but zero in the way of journalistic credentials of any discernible pedigree in journalism scored the fight 30-27 in favor of Machida.[48] - self explanatory

UFC promoter, sport hater, and just bleed advocate, Dana White stated shortly after the fight that he had Machida winning all three rounds,[49] and later told Yahoo! Sports that """"Machida definitely won"""" and """"MMA judging sucks"""".[50] - dana is neither neutral, nor trustworthy, nor an authority on mma scoring. he went on to complain about the hendricks v gsp fight saying its about damage. its not about damage. therefore the man is a liar or an ass. he didnt make the unified rules, has a detailed history of sport hating and attacking judges at all opportunity. he has waged a campaign of journalist tampering and is known for hating elements of the sport, he supposedly champions. 

Fightmetric Analysis shows davis landed more strikes in round 1 2 and over all, and neutralized 80% of Davis' takedown attempts (something not scored in mma), with a significantly higher efficiency rating (and zero explanation of how this was arrived at) through all three rounds.[51] - facts. and the efficiency thing has zero credence, as the site linked has zero explanation attacked for how it arrived at its conclusion. click the explanation button and nothing comes up.

0,"World Serpent Distribution 

Hi 

I see my revisions of the WSD page were undone in preference older page.
The information on the current page is full of misinformation and untruths regarding WSD.
The company was never bankrupt and neither were any of the 3 Directors associated with it.
There was never any court case either.
It is a real pity that nearly 10 yeas after WSD closed down, nobody has bothered to check Companies House or the Royal Courts of Justice.
WSD ceased trading in August 2004, with all stock being returned and delivered to all the artists/bands who requested it.
Some chose to collect in person, some decided not to bother!
For a more accurate portrayal on WSD maybe reference the following:
www.headheritage.co.uk from August 30th 2004 a statement from David Tibet of Current 93.
A small extract:More news on World Serpent...part 1
Aug 30, 2004, 18:37
From David Tibet at Durtro.com

World Serpent: The Carnival is Over

The past and the future

THE PAST (bad trip): As many of you may have heard by now, World Serpent Distribution have ceased trading.

Current 93 and Nurse With Wound, as well as many other groups, have worked with them almost exclusively since 1989. We felt a great closeness with all three of them: Alison Webster, David Gibson and Alan Trench, and they were both our colleagues and our friends. We are very proud of all the work we did together and the beautiful material and editions we issued with and through them. We would like to thank them for all that they have done on our behalf and wish them the best of luck with their futures, and hope we shall all keep in touch remembering the halcyon days and not the unsettled end.
Also Alan Trench's interview for African Paper from March 2012 available online where he expands on the aborted legal action by douglas pearce.
All i was trying to do was redress the balance, as looking at a completely inaccurate and misleading page on WSD is somewhat sad.
I don't think for one minute this will make a difference but if it does then it will go someway to redressing a great injustice.
They deserve better!
Thanks
Reiner"

0,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::I have not yet seen Tim's paper, I assume that it demonstrates that lithium is not an *essential* nutrient by its absence. That doesn't kick it out of OMM. The claim seems that lithium and orotate ions are naturally occurring, utilizable substances in the diet and orthomolecular substances packaged in a salt, similar to common synthetic vitamins, e.g. thiamine nitrate, vs the natural cocarboxylase (pyrophosphate). OMM is not so synthetic friendly to the alien enantiomers in synthetic oil solubles.  However Lithium is most certainly a naturally occuring item in the water of many places; growing up in one place whose water source contained Li this was something of a joke about why people were so mellow. This will come up about others like strontium which are reputed to be good for the bones too, the natural versions considered OMM. Then there is strontium ranelate, a xenobiotic because of the artificial anion.  OMM's relation to pharmacological herbs seems ambivalent for several reasons.  One, probably, is that the largest body adopting the most (adapting from) OMM are probably the naturopaths, so if it is in the approved garden, why sweat it?  Honestly though, there is the question, how do we define xenobiotic and not xenobiotic in OMM? I don't have a fast answer myself between applying Pauling's definition and the definite feeling that some plant extracts are not OMM but xenobiotics.  One can probably develop a Socratic argument starting with hemlock... As for the St John's Wort, the plant contains things that are definitely nutrients. The extract is a homework assignment. This is one of the gray areas where *my impression* is that one may traverse from the orthomolecular field to the herbal part of naturopathy without necessarily encountering a clear boundary. (Sort of like the pressurized, critical path skirting, water heating experiment with no clear phase change between liquid and steam and back) One other comment is that it is ``okay`` if something is not OMM, OMM does not claim to be the ``be all, end all`` answer, or a jealous god, er, guild. OMM MDs do apply conventional drugs and surgery more sparingly, they probably just don't get as many ``free`` boat trips (but the Glacier cruise is nice).  `"

 ==Byte size== 

 http://www.answers.com/topic/byte - answers.com gives good definition of byte. (or http://www.yourdictionary.com/byte). 

 So, real definition of byte is that it is a """"basic unit of digital computer"""". On PC, this basic unit is 8 nowadays, but it used to be 7. Byte is unit, in which files or other data is measured on that specific computer - of course, you can simulate different data types anywhere, but on PC, most hardware data (except flags, which are still usually contained in 8^n bit tuples) is kept in memory area, which is n*8 bits, where n is integer. In cases when data is kept in smaller units, it is called """"compressed"""" - and one piece of compressed units in assembly is usually still contained in 8*n memory area, at least when manipulated with assembler's base commands. 

 So, saying that 1KB must be 1000 bytes is correct, but measuring hardware sizes in bytes is correct only as long as you are using computer, which uses 8-bit characters. When utf-8 becomes more widespread, it's possible that 32-bit bytes will be used instead and this makes KB 4 times larger. So, KB is system-specific notation. Saying that byte is 8 bits would be as good as saying that word is 32 bits (or worse, that integers are 32 bits) - words have been both 16 and 32 bits depending if archidecture is 16 or 32 bits; on 64-bits archidecture it might happen that many languages start to refer 64-bit integers as """"words"""". So, """"word"""" simply means some datatype, which is native enough to do calculations on computer; byte mostly means smallest size of non-empty file or system-managed memory area.  """

Whatever they do I love (so long as they don't cave in and start doing dubstep or something haha). My starry-eyed vision of them may fade in time. For the meantime though I love everything they do.You never know some of the other stuff on the new album (I assume this is going to be on the new album) might live up to your hopes :) Nice one. Epic vid to go with an epic song. Listen to it whenever I'm writing for inspiration :) Nice one. Continue 'proclaiming' them spread the word :)Whenever I do talk about them to friends I usually note that the really popular ones like 500 miles are quite low down in my rankings of all Proclaimers songs. So many songs of theirs which I prefer.I went to see them in Bristol on wednesday and was surprised to see a ten year old (or around that sort of age) there. Good to see some parents are teaching their kids about good music :D Still trying to figure out why Blu-ray version gets sooo much while all the DVD gets is a couple of deleted scenes. Blu-ray players are still a luxury for some of us and they haven't yet fully overtaken DVDs. Thanks so much for uploading this.

 Recent rename to Relationships between American Jewish religious movements 

I don't understand why this article renamed. All of the major movements involved  Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform  have both international histories and a contemporary international presence. The current article content does unduly reflect an American point of view, but this can be fixed. Best,  
I did this because, after reading the page over several times, it only had US denominational connection. True we might all be aware that each of the denominations has an international counterpart - but that isn't reflected on this page, by its creator or subsequent, numerous editors. Of course if this was not the proper thing to do, it can be changed back...but the whole page would need to be heavily added to. It is a shame this couldn't be purged entirely and a new section added to the denomination page. Best wishes,  

Agreeing with Shirahadasha, I don't think it makes sense to limit this article to American movements. Better to fix the content, because the geographic limit is quite artificial. For instance, what about Israeli Orthodox commenting on American movements, or vice versa? We certainly don't want to have this """"relationships"""" topic segmented for UK and Germany and Hungary, because movements and individuals  constantly interact and comment across geographic boundaries. We need to revisit the title.  | Talk 

Before we worry about the world-wide perspective - which I agree would be interesting - perhaps we should focus first on getting a well sourced WP:NPOV article on the USA.  There is a huge amount of material on the US alone to sort through.   

Several problems. (1) Many sources and notable figures do not limit their remarks to a geographic denomination. Hence, when R. Feinstein or Joel Roth comment on other movements, they don't refer only to Jews and organizations within the US. (2) Accordingly, the current article's content is not limited to the US. (3) The discourse of the movements cannot be segregated geographically enough to justify segregated articles. For these reasons, I will would like to move it back and open the discussion here. Thanks.  | Talk 

There is plenty of material available (e.g. historical, socialogical, literary) that is indeed region specific.  This article hasn't even begun to scratch the surface of that material.
Why is it relevant that Joel Roth says things that are worldwide? If claim A applies to US and claim A applies to Israel, then A is appropriate in any of the following three articles: (a) an article on the US (b) an article on israel and (c) an article on the US and israel.
The material on other areas (e.g. israel) is volumous - Israel deserves its own article.
If we write a good article on the US and then start writing one on Israel, and while writing the one on israel notice that we need to reuse material, then we can always add a third article with the shared material.
Even if we need shared material (e.g. for Israel and the US) it does not change the fact that both countries have denominational relationships that are complex enough and sufficiently sourced to each need their own article.
Finally, its better to do a little well, then try to do too much and do it poorly.   

(outdent) The following aspects of the article are not limited to internal USA relationships:
 Haredi views of Modern Orthodox, generally 
 R. Feinstein on non-Orthodox Jews
 Haredia on """"heretical intent and the 1800s widespread denigration of religion.""""
 Modern Ortho on non-Orthodox generally
 R. Soloveitchik  not discussing American non-Ortho alone
 R. Lamm saying """"non-Orthodox rabbis and laypeople may possess spiritual dignity"""" etc
 R. Berger: """"The Jewish loyalties and observances of non-Orthodox Jews are decidedly better than nothing."""" etc
 Conservative views of Orthodox are not limited to American Orthodox, and general view is held by Masorti/Conservative too
 R. Schorsch: """"claimed that Orthodox organizations in Israel politically discriminate against non-Orthodox Jews"""" obviously not US
 The Reform section is not only USA, mostly historical
Given this content, I would like to undo the recent move and switch the burden of proof for changing the name of this long-standing article. This can be done either as a BRD move or as a Requested Move. Thanks. [[U"

I do take offense to Ryulong's comments that I ``forced a closed in my favor``. Aside from a personal attack, this couldn't be further from the truth, the consensus was obvious at the VPP RFC and Ryulong who was in the distinct minority should refrain from baseless attacks. Secondly, I object to calling the previous work on the DBZ page 'unsourced crap'; the content may have been unsourced, but it was not incorrect. The Japanese Wiki is similar to what English wiki once was, and much of it still exists in some form at the wikia. Now, perhaps I may have misinterpreted the silence here, but Xfansd when the policy matter came up you commented that it would have spared a lot of hassle from the get go. Silence can be misleading, especially in circumstances where the previous consensus reasoning has been noted as being on a false premise and the objections to the current RFC were based on that stance and the number of !votes exceeded in support. Allow me to state some topics. I believe  a split for WP:DETAIL would be in order considering this page is a franchise page. Dragon Ball Z has a lengthy history, mostly in America, and I can think of no better way to cover the important history of the development and production by providing a proper page on Dragon Ball Z as a whole.

Se trata del usuario Tprg, ya le he dejado varios mensajes e incluso le dejaron una advertencia y el usuario parece no entender, se la pasa creando posibles artículos de telenovelas que ni han sido confirmadas, lo único que se sabe de cada artículo que el crea son los nombres confirmados + no hay certeza de que estás telenovelas sean transmitidas o no, pueden o no ser canceladas ¿Quién sabe?; ya ha creado estos artículos: No Abras la Puerta‎, La Otra (2015 telenovela)‎, Luisana Mia (2014 telenovela)‎, Buscando a María ,  Caleta El Sol, Chipe Libre, Mi Querido Dilema. Hace días hizo una recreación de artículos borrados como Mi Corazón es Tuyo y Hasta el Fin del Mundo, que otro bibliotecario le borró, esto es algo ya cansante, no se puede estar abriendo una consulta de borrado para cada artículo que este usuario crea. Por eso pido que se tome esto en cuenta, lo único que hace es ignorar los mensajes que se les deja, y yo no pienso seguir dejandoles mensajes. Saludos y gracias ).  TALK2ME 

 Triple Crown 

Hey Hahc, what's the process for receiving a triple crown award? I think I am eligible with Jim Thome (FA), any of several GAs, and any of several DYKs. Thanks.  Phightins! 
Hey! Follow the instructions here: WP:TRIPLE/NOM, and I'll be giving you the Crown soon. Remember to check for which Crown you apply (it appears on the main TC page). → Call me 21

0,"`  ``Ethnical cleansing``? Dear child, there was a different policy towards those Italians who dirtened their hands against locals (Croats, Slovenians...) and towards those that didn't. Otherwise, if Yugoslavia had as a goal to make ethnic cleansing of Italians, how come that Italians had their partisan brigade (and that was in every schoolbook), that there were memorial plaques (dedicated to Italians that joined to partisans) all over Croatia (Garibaldi brigade, if I remember well), that Italians had and have their TV-station in Slovenia, that Italians had and have their newspapers (and publishing house) and theatre and organizations in Croatia?  Second, don't mix those who escaped because of their feeling of guilt, or those who knew that they'll be punished (for their fascist activities and crimes against locals) with persons (manyof them Croats) who used opportunity to leave for the West and avoid advancing Communism. Oh, by the way, did Italy processed fascist officials? We've processed all those that collaborated with nazists and fascists (with very severe penalties, death penalty or losing or being stripped of all citizen rights wasn't rare case). Oh, speaking about ``cleansing``. How many Italians were colonized into Slovenia and Croatia (on occupied and annected areas, on Eastern Adriatic)?  Do you know for the data, that Italian authorities have brought personnel (teachers, artisans, engineers) from Italy into annected and occupied areas, in order to ensure functioning of system (and at the same time increasing the number of Italians there), becaue the locals have boycotted schools (and teachers and pupils) and work in factories?  At last, do you know what the term Italo-optants means?   `"

RE Thryduulf
My closing statement was not aimed at any user in particular, which you can tell by the fact that I did not refer to any users in particular. You did not specify user names, but you did specify users by their arguments: """"unhelpful meta discussion about the use of T: prefixes in general"""", but when an editor writes , incorrectly, you do not use that argument. This way my arguments were rejected explicitly in one stroke, while wrong arguments are still weighing in. The same can be said for the overstated """"consensus"""": not thrown out (more on this later). You also have used the comment that it is , which is a malversion of my arguments (you did not find). From all this I feel & read that only my arguments were targeted off-topic.

... not whether T: redirects in general should be deleted. This is bs. I reasoned like: """"a T: redirect is bad in mainspace, so these twelve should all be deleted"""". Plain sound reasoning. I did use argumental examples in some places, but I did not, nowhere, argue that other, non-listed Rs are to be deleted. It was someone else who expanded it into too wide  not me. Keep'er """"Technical 13"""", I admid this is a third Keep'er, invokes an """"WP:NS#Aliases"""". But this time it must be deemed not too general (I can not follow, but I must conclude that). If """"Keep"""" individual pages were reasoned to be kept, why not conclude the the others are to go? Requirement for individual mentioning only works one way?
Also, in one point you complain that there was """"no discussion about the individual redirects"""". Well, that could also be because an argument applies to the whole list (a logic you disallowed explicitly). Then, when I do point to individually addressed Rs (here above, linked), you do not see a contradiction in that. Even worse, when I do demonstrate there are Rs named specifically, you respond here with but not everybody agreed with you. This does not undo my point that individual templates were addressed. Confusingly, here you are jumping the reasoning.
As was repeatedly pointed out the most recent times that it was discussed the consensus was that at least some were useful and that there was no consensus for a prohibition on their creation or use. Here it is you introducing arguments from *outside* the RfD list at hand. Earlier RfD's outcomes as an argument? How am I allowed to argue with that? WhenI use an argument involving general sanity (not even stepping outside this RfD), it ends up in the bin. And, above I linked tot two more recent R deletion conclusions (a G6 """"non-controversial"""" speedy! March 2013, and a full RfD-list deletion in December 2010), that contradict your reasoning. Also you write T: as a prefix or the use of such prefixes in general in the closing and XfD not RfD here. That is an expansion of the topic beyond RfD. Why is that allowed?
It doesn't matter how long ago a consensus was reached - it applies until there is a newer consensus formed, it doesn't somehow expire.and Consensus can change, and older consensuses are often more likely to, but ....  No  was reached. Repeat: there is no consensus. You are repeating an editors' 2007 injection -not a conclusion- into an essay. With that, indeed it is irrelevant how long ago the irrelevance was written: today it is still irrelevant. II note that you took over this bogus claim from an editor. As for old or new 'consensus': can an admin research & report how many T:-redirect were deleted without RfD, over the years? Of course, they leave almost no trace for non-admins. But I'd like to see the numbers & arguments for all T:-redirect deletions since template space was introduced. Some 'consensus' must be visible in there too. There is no consensus. So there is no argument from that  non-existent consensus. And don't blame me for introducing """"history"""" as a reason. 

Yes, you argued about specific redirects, but not everybody agreed with you. Out of logic. Why do you say this? You concluded that there was no individual targeting (and check that the nom is addressing them by listing them, and that the nom is detailing arguments very specific). The I point to them, and you jump to arguments. Did you or did you not see them when closing?

 In particular your proving that transclusion didn't work was argued to be not relevant to way the redirect was used (remember these are redirects to templates not templates), and and your opinion alone does not demonstrate consensus. A catch 22 you created. First you complain that no individual Rs were mentioned, then I point to one that was already there, and then you say: but that is not consensus. Yeah, and what did you expect, of an argument??? You only accept arguments that so"

I just recall that De728631 has been considered involved after he blocked me during 3 days, a decision proven unfounded and cancelled after the appeal from  . It is cristal clear that there's nothing solved here, and I agree with ,  and  that the article has many other flaws that we could address first. 
 Culture: the section is indeed too big and should be thought as a glance inviting the interested reader to explore the Culture of Paris detailed article. We can also feel a certain trend to mix that section up with the more mainstream Culture of France article. I think an overhaul is necessary in order to focus more on the key elements to understand what is specific to the Paris identity: theatres, the movie industry, impressionist school, few key writers and singers, and the current state of today's Paris cultural life.
 Landmarks by district: that section, currently listing 450 different buildings, is totally unreadable in its current form. It should be replaced by a more general """"Monuments and Landmarks"""" section, if not by an even broader """"Visitor attractions"""" section with not more than 20 different mentions. Once again, there is already a standalone article for the Landmarks in the City of Paris which is more reader-friendly for those wanting to explore a more detailed list of those.
Even if that doesn't solve ongoing conflicts, focusing first on these 2 sections is probably the best way to get back to more constructive contributions to the article.   """

You were making the (good) point that simply reversing F and a in the cause and effect statement seems intuitively absurd in this case.  But the F in statement 1 is the forward force exerted on the back, not the backward force by the back, and the a is the acceleration of the person, not of the bus.  ::If we make the reversal one of switching equal and opposite forces carefully, we come up with ``The backward force of the back on the bus causes the acceleration of the bus to be lower than it otherwise would be`` which is different than the way you wrote it.  In this case there is no intuitive absurdity at all.  Both cause and effect statements are equally intuitive.  ::Crowsfoot is right that F=ma, or its fluid dynamics equivalent, doesn't by itself indicate an asymmetric cause and effect relationship.  If causes must precede effects, then we could even argue that F=ma forbids a either causal interpretation, since it refers to instantaneous values of both F and a (and m).    ::But its helpful to the reader, I think, to go with the intuitively appealing bias that net forces (pressure differences) cause accelerations (of bodies or particles, or for us, of differential volumes of fluid).  The real difficulty comes when the reader wants to know if the pressure field is caused by the flow field, or vice versa.  We must get him/r to abandon this truly meaningless question, I believe, and understand that Newton's differential equation, and the continuity and mass conservation constraints all have to hold at the same time.  The infinite set of 3d velocity vectors and the infinite set of local pressures have to be consistent with each other, and there is no intuitively meaningful way to say that one causes the other.   ::      `"

0,"Instead of making the same mistake that many make stop and think a bit. The Church councils were not about making up anything. what happened was that the church always believed the Bible and never questioned it. When some misguided fool would start to preach a false doctrine that went against the Bible then the church simply said hay look the Bible says this and if you reject what the Bible says then you cannot be a Christian. There were no conspiracies or dark room meeting. Why didn't the church have a set Cannon until about the 320 ADs - because there were no fake writings until the Gnostic gospels were written and some were fooled by them so the church was forced to make a list of the real Bible verse the Gnostic ones. Why did the Church have to speak about the deity of Jesus - because the gnostic Cults began to make up false writings and so the church simple said - JOHN SAID JESUS WAS GOD BELIEVE IT OR GET OUT. The same thing is happening today. Why is there so much talk about Homosexuality in the church today - Simple, there was no need to speak of it until the Homosexual community started to twist the Bible and now the church is forced to say HAY THIS IS WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS. It happened in the 1860 regarding Slavery and I'm sure it will happen in the furture when some other group comes along and tries to add to the Bible.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN"

How are you Warrens?

I was wondering if you knew much about the Microsoft WGA program. I know there are a lot of people who think this program is spyware. My understanding was that it could be classified under this category because of how Microsoft destributes it as a critical security update on Windows Update. Not to mention the stories I have heard about the tool phoning home to Microsoft on a regular basis. One other strange thing that I have been hearing from my friend about is people going and validating their PC on the Microsoft Download Center to access a downolad. After the download is complete they run an antispyware program and find that the WGA validation tool has caused a Browser Hijack attempt. I do not know if these stories would be good material for the WGA article here on Wikipedia. I am still searching the web to see if I can find evidence to back some of this up.

Also notice that”anti” editors have disagreed over the wording of so called “anti TM” sources meaning that they became more neutral in tone (see physiology section.).

This is because, reading this article, one would assume that there is a general consensus in the scientific community that TM meditation – or indeed any meditation –has large and demonstrate health benefits including, increasing your life expectancy, curing cancer, and prevent coronary disease! However this is clearly not the case. I understand that as webmaster to NSR  (and thank you for the honesty of at least adding this to your profile) this maybe difficult to believe as your much cheaper form of mediation relies on the research of TM to promote it – but the research that supports such findings is blatant nonsense and no such agreement exits within the scientific community.

0,"`  == The precise definition of race is under dispute.. ==  I wrote this to help spread understanding, please make sure to read the definitions of outcrossing on the link.  -  There is a lot of misunderstanding of genetics and further there is a lot of misinformation that people spread because they WANT you to think that there is no difference between peoples for a political or social agenda, that does not make it so. Humans share 98% of our genetic code with Chimpanzees, yet that 2% defines our differences and is important as is the difference in the human population, no matter how small the difference.  There are obviously differences in the expressed traits between Asian, African and Caucasian. These are different types of humans, if you choose to call the a race/breed or type it's up to you and it's immaterial. My argument has always been that racial diversity should be preserved which is a more neutral position rather than promoting that race mixing and interbreeding is somehow positive.  You and many people that listen to pop culture may think that by interbreeding you are helping humanity and there are lots of myths about how you will create better offspring; offspring that have the best of both parents. This is just a myth told by people who, are trying to say that people are equal, if different. Yes, people are people as Americans we believe that all people have certain inalienable rights but the best position for humanity is for each of the races to exist, separately to be the best we can. If you truly understand the advantages that diversity offers you will agree too.  I personally breed horses. And this is where I'll start telling you a story: the Thoroughbred horse started out as a mixed race horse. It was based on Arab stock and was bred only for speed for many generations, regardless of breed, the horse that ran the race the fastest was bred to other fast horses. The Thoroughbred breeding book is now closed, which means you cannot breed a Thoroughbred to any other breed, because, ANY cross you make outside of the gene pool will reduce the speed of the horse. This is called line breeding, please read this article as a basic ``learn to breed`` guideline: http://www.learntobreed.com/linebreeding.html. Line breeding(inbreeding) is a useful technique as is outcrossing when advantagous to produce quality results, random mixing is like a child finger-painting and does nothing positive.  What Wikipedia has been proposing is that random interbreeding is potentially a good idea and should be treated as potentially positive. Any person who knows about breeding animals will disagree, it's very unlikely that race mixing will result in a positive result unless it was planned for by a geneticist. When you cited the plant hybridization, that's what you were doing citing a hybrid that was designed in a laboratory and there were not human beings or living animals as a result of a genetic mistake. You can't through bad human crosses in the trash like you can with corn.`"

 Questions about a certain [reversion] edit   

I have some questions about this edit. 

I did not remove the character string that [supposedly] is the title.  That is, the string that is the title according to the """"edit comment"""" which says: """"um, no, the title is the line above that"""".] 

On the other hand, this edit (see above) did remove the character string that (IMHO) was a better title.  (That is, the string that I thought was better, as [all or part of] a """"title"""" for the web page with the URL of http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon;_id=128944 .) 

I am not immediately ready to """"insist"""" that leaving in both of those two character strings is the best choice.  (However, if you have any comments about that """"idea"""", I am willing to listen.)  

I am prepared to try to reach some consensus.  Is there anything we can do to explore (or discuss) (or, explain to each other) the goals that are [perhaps] to be achieved by choosing well, [and carefully] which character string to use as the """"title""""?   (or, maybe that should say, << the goals that are """"more nearly"""" to be achieved >> by doing so) (- ? -). 

Would it benefit anyone (perhaps in pursuing the above mentioned goals?) if one of us were to explore (or discuss) (or, explain) the reasons why the use of the character stringSabal Adanson ex Guersent, Bulletin des Sciences, par la Societe Philomatique. 87: 205-206. 1804 for the """"title"""", would be better? 

Do we both understand (thoroughly and well) what each word of that """"title"""" means, and what its role is, in doing whatever things a title is supposed to be helpful for?  (such as, describing the """"topic"""" of a certain web page, and informing the reader a little bit, what a certain web page is """"about"""" - ? - ) 

Do we both (or, do any of us) think that this """"title""""Sabal Adanson ex Guersent, Bulletin des Sciences, par la Societe Philomatique. 87: 205-206. 1804 comes closer to describing the """"topic"""" of the web page, or otherwise (in some sense) doing thoroughly and well those things that a title is [/slash, """"should"""" be] helpful for? 

Have both of us [sufficiently] considered the question of what the web page with the URL of (value of the """"url"""" field) is about?  IMHO, it comes pretty close to being about """"Palmetto"""".  I could be wrong... 

I hope this does not sound [too] negative.  I hope that there is still a chance that one of us can wake up and learn something, that is not already known (at least, something that we don't both already know).  So, maybe there is hope for a happy, win-win outcome, that will be the best for all concerned.  (It would even be fine with me, if [after reaching some consensus successfully] we were to nuke this whole section, if [e.g.] we both wanted to delete it before it got in to any """"archive"""" files.) """"No harm / no foul.""""  (getting in to """"history"""" logs,  or, """"remaining"""" in them  might be a different matter.) 

You are welcome (btw) to answer some questions that I did not [know to] ask.  (""""if any"""").  

The kindness of a response (and/OR an edit that restores the word """"Palmetto"""") would be appreciated.  Thank you.    """

 Seth Material 

Oasis, thank you for the supportive comments that you made on the Seth Material talk page recently.

If you are truly a new editor, there are some things you need to know.  Wikipedia's rules governing editing and the behavior of editors are very poorly written.  They encourage people who have nothing else to do to spend hours and hours on the site each day.  However, once an editor has exhausted his knowledge, any contributions he makes after that are of dubious value.  The result is that there are contingents of what I call """"Wiki-addicts"""" who make little positive contribution to the encyclopedia, but who make a lot of trouble for other editors.  They generally call themselves """"skeptics"""", and they spend hours each day attacking articles they don't like.  They fancy themselves to be guardians of neutrality, but their edits are rarely neutral.  They also fancy themselves to be Wikipedia experts, and consequently they are rarely willing to collaborate.  Generally, they are atheists, right-wing Christians and political conservatives, and they attack articles on topics that are not in the mainstream, especially in the area of religion.  The Seth Material article has suffered from such attacks since it was created a couple years ago.  Recently, several """"skeptics"""" ganged up on me and got me kicked off the article.  The editors who are now in control of it have no knowledge of the Seth Material whatsoever, beyond the fact that they don't like it, so the article is now controlled by editors who would prefer to delete the article altogether.  They have already cut out portions of it.  If you want to see the most complete version of the article, look for the version edited by """"Itsmejudith"""".  You'll find text in there that has since been deleted.

Basically, my message to you is that Wikipedia is a hostile environment, especially if you are interested in topics of religion or spirituality.  If you have things to say in those areas, it is best to do it on your own web site.  With so many editors on Wikipedia intent on censoring information they don't like, it is very hard to make contributions in those areas without getting into non-stop edit-wars.  """

0,"NEWLINE_TOKEN:::: And I've brought it back. First of all, you did not bother to discuss whether this section should be removed before doing so. In stark contrast to you, I proposed adding this section and, after ensuring I could give proof of my claims, I added it. You decided to remove it and then gave your rationale, which has a major drawback. You see, mainstream newspapers would never bother reporting about an online game (let's face it, online games are usually seen as a counterproductive pastime and a bit of a luxury, especially in times like these, with the financial crisis tearing entire societies apart). So far, I've yet to see an article in a mainstream newspaper about Ikariam or ERepublik or Silk Road Online. It is a perfectly sourced section, with a screenshot proving that the spam campaign took place (and, mind you, it's one of many that have been sent to numerous Grepolis players in Greece during the past two weeks). If anything, it's something that actually took place and its verifiability cannot be denied. If you want, I can give a few more screenshots of previous spam messages. Oh, and another reason why this section should stay: it helps raise the issue of possible exploitation of nationalist tendencies among users to achieve various goals (one could be the popularization of nationalism through online games, another could be an increase of the number of players). Perhaps you might think only a loser would bother joining an online game just to get into a confrontation with another nation (with which his/her country may be at odds), but it happens and we cannot deny it, especially when we have proof and evidence.

0,"""Hi again, all.  I wasn't too clear about what Piotr (and now M0RD00R too) wanted me to look at, Piotr says that it is this section he was mainly concerned about.  I mentioned it below, but I have a bit more to say and will be clearer.  I don't think the Boddenheimer stuff is acceptable.  Nor is the """"Polish independence following World War I was accompanied by a wave of pogroms and discrimination against Jews.""""  They just don't have enough to do with the topic of the article, even considered widely.  They're OR, SYN, will raise blood pressure and are fattening to everybody's girlish figure. 

We come again to the crucial question of what is this article about, to which I add another distinction: (a) ghetto benches considered narrowly - this particular discriminatory measure  (b) Discrimination against Jews in education in Poland (wider)  (c) Antisemitism in Polish universities, in Polish education (widest).  (b) or (c) seem to be reasonable, popular choices. This is something that people are just going to have to think hard about and come to a consensus.  What is OR depends on what we decide the article is about, since it is clear that we are using """"ghetto benches"""" a bit figuratively.  Changing the title is a possibility. Under (c), but probably not (b), the replacement from the notes that I suggested, the quote from Meltzer -""""In fact, ever since the attainment of independence, the universities in Poland had been strongholds of Endejca supporters and centers for anti-semitic agitation.” would be acceptable. Again, I don't see how Boddenheimer or """"Polish independence . . .discrimination against Jews """" fits in under any reasonable conception.

0,"  I wonder why you think it's absurd to a) try and raise funds for those harmed by a natural disaster and b) to prove once and for all that these repetitive - almost chanting - claims I am Ennis are false. If the 'Number is Ennis' dichotomy was removed the Talk Pages would be near empty! I wonder why you condemn my attempts to bring honesty to these pages.  But, that's rhetorical - as I said, there must be certain camaraderie among Wiki people and I doubt if you’d want to jeopardise that even if your quest was integrity.  Now you have asked me a sensible question, so I'll answer.  For some time I watched these pages and saw that posts from people in the UK/claiming they were in the UK were summarily dismissed. Worse, posters were automatically accused of being Ennis.  One reason given was that the posts were anonymous.  So I thought, as I know more about Ennis than others from the UK posting here (IMO) I'd try to add to these pages. However, even with an identity, I got exactly the same treatment. In fact Cardinal Chunder also got the same treatment even though he has an anti-Sollog website and is well known in Google groups for arguing with sollog(ites).  So it became clear that it would be impossible to add anything constructive unless either the accusations 'You're a sock puppet! You’re Ennis!' were either suppressed or disproved.  I therefore asked what the criteria would be to 'prove' I was not Ennis - and presumably this criteria would apply to others.   I tried to prove I was not in America (I thought these days all IPs were traceable but perhaps the 'proxy argument' holds sway - though quite how 'proxies work' is beyond me) I quoted extracts from a newspaper that was not on the net.  This was dismissed.  Someone else even went to a pub in Lyndhurst and posted what was next to where he was sitting.  That too was dismissed.  So it became obvious that no proof I (or anyone else) was not Ennis would ever be accepted.  Therefore the only other option if I felt I had something to contribute would be to suppress the hyena-like accusations (never backed up BTW)  In vain did I quote Wiki Official Policy. Plainly it is not obeyed by Editors/Administrators vis a vis the treatment of contributors.  So what is left? I cannot invoke Wiki policy. I cannot 'prove' I am here, in England sitting quietly in front of a PC.  Two choices.  Stop posting completely  Try and 'challenge' the main accuser so once and for all this behaviour would stop. The only challenge worth it would be one where I did not personally gain (Of course I would win because I am not Ennis) and where proof involving a third party held in esteem (e.g. Ashley) acted as 'witness'.  Hence the challenge.  I fear that will be deleted; I'll be castigated a usual and that's that. It really is just hopeless.  I have started deleting all my posts and if the challenge is reverted I’ll know there simply is no hope and I'll delete all my posts if I can find them.  You see, unless people accept I am not Ennis everything I or anyone else writes who is similarly accused will simply be dismissed. I'd prefer it if people read the post without looking at the poster - but they don't.  I have other interests - I posted on the Yoga page but it's quiet and I am interested in politics etc etc.  So we'll see what happens. Like I said, my view is that it's just hopeless trying to treat others as adults as all some want to do is - and they admit this - bait, bait and bait and if you do rise to it you're banned and if you don't it shows your inability. Truly a page that brings out the juvenile in what I assume are adults.  So there you are. I have answered your question fully and honestly and we'll just see what happens. It will answer the question - at least for these Sollog pages - as to whether Wiki should be taken seriously or not.  Finally if, as expected, the post is reverted it will provide a fitting end to the article I am writing (I am a freelance writer and no, I’m not going to prove it) before I send it off to newspapers. If it is accepted though I shall return just the once, to link to the article!   "

Perhaps, covering it as its 'commonly known' whiskey version, then as the general drink of whiskey, or brandy, or Holland gin, sugar, water, and bitters, as Kappeler documented in his 1895 guide, is necessary.  Given the origin of the Old-Fashioned & its direct connection to the original Cock-Tail, non-whiskey versions must be accepted. They were common as Cock-Tails, and as Old Fashioneds in 19th century, as they are today. Also, even if it hurts, the once ubiquitous versions full of fruit and soda water, though hard to find in any guides, probably should be covered. There's also an Old Fashioned, which I think might derive from Hugo Esslin's Old-Fashioned Appetizer (rye, Doubonnet, curacao, absinthe), which contains whiskey, vermouth, orange juice. it's pretty bad. I've been served it several times, in all parts of the U.S., but cannot find any documentation. It's probably a bartending school recipe.

Apparently you didn't, so I'm rephrasing it: in my honest oppinion the relation between a state that was formed in the effect of the Polish-Lithuanian conflict of 1922 and the Russian revolution of 1917 is obscure, to say the least. The Republic of Central Lithuania was neither formed because of the revolution nor during it. I kindly ask you to explain the connection between the Russian revolution and Central Lithuania before you put back the category. I know that the communist propaganda portrayed the independence of much of Central and Eastern Europe as a consequence of one of Lenin's speeches in which he gave those states (he did not have influence on whatsoever) a right to secede, though this doesn't hold the water at all.   ::Also, I do not monitor your talk page so please respond at my talk page rather than yours.

 Replaceable fair use Image:AvnerCat.jpg 

Thanks for uploading Image:AvnerCat.jpg. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:

 Go to the image description page and edit it to add , without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template.
 On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on [ this link]. Note that fair use images which could be replaced by free-licensed alternatives will be deleted 7 days after this notification, per our Fair Use policy.  If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you. — Carl ( · talk) """
0,"""I just read the article, and I must say, I'm disappointed. This is an example of liberal bias. In the section """"Exceptionalism"""", there is a sentence """"Much, if not all, of United States foreign policy has roots that can be traced back to this ideology.""""  Whoever made that remark needs to back it up with proof, not the opinions of a single liberal historian. Also, where is the mention of Stalin's speechs, where he basically says that global communism can never succeed until capitalism has been destroyed? This article is an attempt at making America and the USSR equally responsible for the Cold War. What a crock of shit. Is there any mention of Kruschev's (spelling?) """"we will bury you"""" comments? What about the Cuban missile crises? Too much space is dedicated to showing how historians disagree about the cold war, and not enough is dedicated to the major events of the cold war. This article is a disappointment and needs to be fixed. Liberal bias belongs in America's public school system, not in wikipedia. 

 Why isnt the causes of the USSR's downfall listed?  

 Let me guess, if a person comes into your home and tries to kill you, they are not evil, just of a different opinion, an opinon I should respect, right?

0,"Yep. It's I guess if you forgive my bard level faggotry, delightfully flawed- or at least it's characters are, and flawed but not shit written characters are the best ones IMO.  Kazuma despite of everything is the most competent in his party by dozens of leagues, because he's the only one that completely controlled by pure whim, and arguably lust. Which sounds hilarious given what a horndog he is, but regardless of how often his ""steal"" ability grants him frilly unmentionables, this is not his intent- it's just a roll of the dice( well his second use when he got megumin's knickers I think he was trying for them- but I think he was going for aqua's because he wanted to humiliate the conceited harpy cunt. He just doesn't get them due to fan theory that I agree with, that she doesn't WEAR any and if they exist his steal ability seems to have a laser guided focus on lady lace, so it went to the target a foot over which was wearing some.  Still, think of it megumin refuses to learn any skills that doesn't buff her explosion magic, it may be because she sees it as the ultimate cool and her race is like cool for it's own sake magical otakus, but given how she behaves talking about her one spell or using it, she seems to *literally* get off on using it- even more suggested by her demand to be able to shoot off one nuke a day even if there isn't anything that needs it- though given her age and the fact she might have just found the puberty fairy(but sadly not the boob fairy) the spell might actually get her off, and unlike what some people claim girls can be just as much(and the more years I live I suspect even MORE)horny than dudes, and given found the awesomeness of explosion orgasms she ain't gonna give that up if she can at all help it. Then there is the wondrous clusterfuck of useless lust that is darkness, which you don't even have to imagine being there- it's shamefully(how appropriate) shown for all the world to see. Who my theory was intentionally gimped her accuracy stats- or might well be *deliberately* missing her strikes because as is shown by vanir when he controls her, she can hit like a mac truck on hate and crack. Well what fun is one shotting monsters when she honestly seems like she'd rather be an adventurer in the goblin slayer universe? She'd rather be taking the hits than giving them. honestly it would make more sense if she just bought a shield and never took a sword with her- then again that might also defeat the *purpose* for her.  In comparison kazuma is going massively into jack of all trades, which usually gimps the fuck out of you in most games- video games anyway, maybe it works better in p&p games where the point is writing a story through your actions so letting you do whatever you want as long as it doesn't fuck with the dm's plot is encouraged. Also given how cripplingly insanely overspecialized the other party members are the only way to save the party is probably for someone to go full utility. Save aqua. Oddly enough she has power and mana and to spare, her idiocy is what makes her useless. That and her spoiled bitchy attitude. Take the frogs, now I dind't know this until someone who may have guessed or it's spelle dout in the other mediums, that the reason she didn't kill the fuck out of it with shit like godblow was because being a **WATER** goddess, even her holy attacks still have a dual element with water. If she wasn't stupid she'd *KNOW* that and not try to directly attack the frogs with spells and just buff or heal kazuma. Fuck she was so stupid when she was smiting the dulahan she didn't seem tot think her smiting/turning didn't have *any* effect on him because it didn't one shot him, despite him rolling on the ground screaming. You'd think she was an earth goddess for how fucking dense she is.  #tookinkytotorture #itisn'trapeifyouwantit"

0,"   A tag has been placed on Camelion, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please add  on the top of the page and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position.   Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines.

The effort is real, and the standards are PCC's own standards; while most secular and mainstream Christian places don't acknowledge these degrees, they are very much respected in fundamentalist Christian circles. It's possible to give students an unaccredited or even worthless degree without being properly definable as a ``diploma mill``.  00:43, 23 December`"

The fact that McCormick's birth date was changed can prove a point that data for this article is arbitrarily written with no real verifiable data/source or document to support it. The person who poses for this personality is actually named Kathy Davis, a cousin of Eddie Vedder's, who also pretends to be his spouse but is actually the girlfriend of Pearl Jam fan club manager Tim Bierman. Also one needs to check the information on her children. They are not Vedder's but Bierman's. No reliable source supports the claim that Vedder is actually the father.

 Naming convention 

I would like to resurrect my previous idea to change the current naming convention for elections. The current convention is:

Use the format """"Demonym type election, date"""", for example """"Canadian federal election, 1867""""...  (WP:NAME#Elections}

I propose this is changed to allow two alternatives, as follows:

Use either this form: political division type election, date, or this form: political division election of date. For example, Canadian federal election, 1867 or Canadian federal election of 1867.  Where an article has been created using one form, do not move the article to the other form.

This new option would make linking more natural and make the article names more encyclopedic.

The Stearns Jazz Dance has many instances of this. However at the Savoy Ballroom one of the ways of dancing slow was called ``The Ballroom`` which is what can be seen in The Spirit Moves. Although the number ``Tain't Nobody's Business`` was superimposed over the film of the dancing during the editing of the film, it is reasonably close enough to give some idea about how the music and dance worked together, and as has already been pointed out it wasn't always danced to 12-bar blues music. I don't have a copy to hand, but if my memory is accurate there is a particularly fine example of the ``The Ballroom`` being danced in this section by ``Big Nick`` (they guy with the sweat patch on the back of his suit jacket) and ``Sugar`` Sullivan.

While any edit warring may lead to sanctions, there is a bright-line rule called the three-revert rule (3RR), the violation of which often leads to a BLOCK. The three-revert rule states: An editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page—whether involving the same or different material—within a 24-hour period. An edit or a series of consecutive edits that undoes other editors' actions—whether in whole or in part—counts as a revert. Violations of the rule normally attract BLOCKS of at least 24 hours. Any appearance of gaming the system by reverting a fourth time just outside the 24-hour slot is likely to be treated as an edit-warring violation. See below for exemptions. A ``page`` means any page on Wikipedia, including talk and project space. A ``revert`` means any edit (or administrative action) that reverses the actions of other editors, in whole or in part, whether involving the same or different material. A series of consecutive saved revert edits by one user with no intervening edits by another user counts as one revert. The three-revert rule applies per person, not per account; reverts made by multiple accounts operated by one editor count together. Editors violating 3RR will usually be BLOCKED for 24 hours for a first incident. Even without a 3RR violation, an administrator may still act if they believe a user's behavior constitutes edit warring, and any user may report edit warring with or without 3RR being breached. The rule is not an entitlement to revert a page a specific number of times. If an editor violates 3RR by mistake, they should reverse their own most recent reversion. Administrators may take this into account and decide not to BLOCK in such cases—for example if the user is not a habitual edit warrior and is genuinely trying to rectify their own mistake.``   `"

0,"  I did not perceived you attempt to discussion, sorry. Actually the article is doing worst possible by the so named “finding of a number only” there estimations which are intentionally increased like the “Centre Against Expulsions” work. Unnecessary you need to point on somebody who is responsible it is enough offensive providing numbers which are subjective and biased. There are official more or less numbers of all nations population killed in WW II. You should start from this, until I know the Germany lost 8.7% of population in it 2 810 000 civilians. Thus it is impossible that the numbers can reach 3 millions during expulsion. Are you count also those who were collaborators of Nazi Germany? Well, … I ask you to be reasonable. Do not put numbers which are just somebody biased “supposition”. Any way I found only one non-German estimation, which are Cold War effort most probably. Do you have UN or other independent sources regarding this numbers? Instead public “findings” which are very irritating you should look for objective source of information. Private multiplication of possibilities is offending. Do you know it? It is particularly such if you consider that other nations in fact lost much more and were not responsible for spark the hell of war. In total proportion for one German in the WW II was kill ten people of other nations. When somebody unleash beware dog who the culprit is? Dog or the person, and this is the case. I do not contradicts that after the WWII could occur lawlessness and lynches. Are you surprised of it? I am not, but you see if in competition during the 80’s the Soviets would invade Poland and Jaruzelski would support it in some way – we would blame Jaruzelski for our deaths in first place. The Soviets we world also, but first and above all Jaruzelski. He was the totalitarian and collaborator. Exactly the Germans should immediately and in first place blame Hitler and Nazi, though some love the Nazi ideology and activity. Instead I see the article where numbers are juggled for God knows what.  Thus I say to you the article look unbalanced and with bad faith. I just do not have time to discuss details as it is from the start bad. The tags are unimportant until you will point to Hitler and Nazi in first sentence as the primary culprits. You or others definitely opposed the introductions, so…? The “recent” is not for philosophical deliberations. I took the word and sentence from the same article written long before I knew about it. Just I emphasize existing points – maybe deliberately hidden somewhere in the back and under carpet. Again, somebody dos not like the truth? Put “most recent” if you like. Do you? You must be referring to Overmans and Ingo Haar, two historians. Does the total number two really justify a plural expression? Anyway, let's take a look at them. I agree that total number of German deaths in Poland could be 1.1 milions. Twice there, 6 years of ocupations and guerrilla warfare, escape front od Soviet Army in winter 1944 and last the expulssion, which I can be shure was fewest deadly. But be specific with this numbers do not stick others. I very much beleave that in the post war phase the were revanges, but again are you surprised ?– evry 5th person in Poland was killed. Are you expecting after the “total war” against civilians evry of Polish citizen will be ideal christian and give you other chick to hit. If that was expected so it means the Nazi sin is all the more bigger. Also, the XX236 sugestion is good . Change the title of the article. Best A. "

 Sourcing

A fifty-year old German-language journal article is more than a tad inaccessible, making it problematical as a general reference  as even if you could get your hands on it, a non-fluent-German reader would have difficulty browsing it to see where it says what.

0,"This article confuses several different types of anti-personnel ammunition - originally called 'shrapnel' (after its inventor), 'grape' and 'cannister'.  Shrapnel and cannister seem to have been mainly land service ammunition while 'grape' seems to have been mainly naval.

Shrapnel was invented circa 1800, but later that century it was used with more modern shaped shells.  A shrapnel shell is like a flying shotgun, the bullets are ejected while the shell is in flight by a small charge and they fly forwards in a cone.  The charge is initiated by a time fuze (igniferious at this period)in the shell's nose, which is blown clear as the bullets leave.  Bullet sizes varied, but by WW1 they were usually lead antimony alloy with a few hundred bullets per pound weight.

Cannister, in contrast, is bullets in a can and the can bursts as it is fired.  This means cannister is short range.  While shrapnel was little used in WW2, cannister was developed for various weapons including tanks.  Australian Centurion tanks in Vietnam had 20-pdr cannister.

Cannister was always carried by British artillery in its 19th century campaigns and quite widely used. Sometimes it had to be locally assembled from old bully-beef cans. Shrapnel remained their primary anti personnel weapon into WW1, and always the ammunition of choice against 'troops in the open'. In 1945 they successfully trialled 95mm shrapnel fuzed VT.

Beehive, correctly called Splintex, was developed by the US in the Vietnam period.  It is a shrapnel type shell - it is fitted with a mechanical time fuze and the flechettes are fired forward from the shell in flight. It was available for 105mm arty, 106mm RCL, 90mm RCL, and probably others.  US policy was for splintex to be only fired at direct fire, ie for arty it was local defence only, presumably for fear of blinds being re-cycled by the enemy into IEDs.  However, the USSR appears to have subsequently developed 122mm and 152mm shells of this type and used them for indirect fire."

0,"Honestly the way wiki is treating this is a JOKENEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENa. I could have cited NEWS SITES but since when is a news site worthy of an academic cite?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENb. if the person that wanted PEER REVIEW felt like it, he would have sought it 20 years ago, HE CHOSE NOT TO DO IT, but none the less his work is known and was mentioned in many math related 'forums' and most ignored it. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENc. Only the recent 2012 open source test of the work PROVED the 30Mod algorithm is a major thing in math, again, GITHUB is a programmers resource and it was not until a computer used the actual 30Mod algorithm that it was shown to be a 'big thing' and since then some news sites have covered it, but I chose not to cite them due to IMO they are not NPOV. But none the less they covered the story.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENd. The FACT is a major computer site where programmers have free reign to challenge any claims exists and for over two years not one programmer challenged the findings.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENe. so what if the person that discovered it works outside of academia and has no regard for normal 'peer review' the fact is he has no peers if you ask some in academia that know of his work, and I am one of those people that know of the work and how brilliant the work is.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow to summarize, we have a bunch of pags about primes on wiki, and even pages created after his discovery that USE his discovery (ie. the sieve of Atkin 60Mod work is his work discussed in the public forum and usenet math and physics forums is where he chose to discuss his amazing work.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo now you have 2004 sieve of Atkin using a 60Mod algorithm, guess what that was in his 1995 paper. So does wiki acknowledge that? No. And i didn't even bother to waste my time of the 60 mod algorithm since the big deal as you are saying is the PyPrimes test and I cited that very well, it's a program created in Python, I cited the wiki python page, then I cited Github for both PyPrimes and the PyPrimes testing.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow while MATH is m forte, I am sufficient enough in computer skills to understand what Github is and to understand how to read the speed tests and the prime spirals smoked every algorithm there is. Now anyone can download python (which I have done) and download pyprimes (which I have done) and run the tests. Guess what just like a math experiment, it is duplicated.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo GITHUB and the tests which are not 'new' should be enough to begin a wiki page on this truly amazing discovery in math.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI myself became aware of the first paper in 1995, as did others in aademia. Recently I became aware of 'news sites' running stories citing what I copied, the links to the Github tests.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhile some here can say well it's not AMA, so what, in the world of primality testing primes spirals as per the PyPrimes results shows PRIME SPIRALS are a big deal.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow I tried to be NPOV in giving all sides of the story, Adoni has a valid 1995 claim I can verify it and I chose not to. But I cited a Drexel Math forum and I could have cited many other math sites discussing his 30mod, 60mod and 90mod prime work in the 1990's. Is this signficant? You bet it is since 60Mod prime sieve aka Atkin sieve is 20004 so his 60mod prime work is well before it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow the Github tests mentions 'croft spirals', that's due to in 2010 a person named croft registering a web site and ripping off the 1995 work. MY OPINION.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow Croft can say all he wants that he found it playng his guitar or whatever he is claiming.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe fact is anyone can document Adoni with Prime theory from the 1990's saying 30mod, 60mod and 90mod is the key.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN9 Years later sieve of atkin appears, well that's only a rehash of the adoni 60mod work from the 1990's. Yet no one is giving him credit.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2010 croft puts out his 30Mod work and its inserted into PyPrimes on Github and it smokes every major prime algorithm there is and all of them have pages on wiki as I cited.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo 2012 a work on Github verifies how important to primality the 30mod spirals are, but he says croft spirals, well guess what HelixQ is now out there and taking 100% credit for the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMy site to a Drexel math site from the 1990's mentioning 30Mod prime work (prime spirals) is a major cite, since Adoni could care less about the AMA or whatever, in all probability he will soon be nominated for a Nobel on his work, that is how important it is. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThink about it, not one prime algorithm could beat the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, none of them. On a computer creating primes all other algorithms are terribly slow. The only two fast generators from scratch are the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes and the PRIME SPIRALS, and the winner was Prime Spirals. Now I can cite recent news articles about it, laughing at academics it links to that said it was no big deal in the 1990's who now all look foolish due to the PyPrimes tests.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSO PUT BACK THE ARTICLE and let the debate begin, others will agree with me, the PyPrimes tests are a legitimate academic cite.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow the issue is only what do we call the 8 Prime Spirals, I called the page 8 PRIME SPIRALS aka Adoni Spirals, since Adoni is the person that in the 1990's who was saying here is the 30mod algorithm (8 prime spirals) the 60mod and 90mod prime algorithms.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSuch a Draconian response of mods is a joke, it's why no one in Academia cites wiki. NO ONE DOES.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYet I chose to put up a wiki page since I'm familiar with the whole story for almost 20 years and the PyPrimes results are a 'big deal'.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDr. Adoni will win a Nobel prize over it, it's that BIG in math to out perform the sieve of Eratosthenes as validated in the PyPrimes program.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  drprincetonNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN"

But anonymously on the Internet, when using it as a direct quote or when analyzing it as a word? We are so scared of being called racist that we are afraid to type the word anonymously when using it in a completely legitimate context. 

Fuck that. It's a word. It can be used to hurt people. That doesn't mean we have to cower from it and hide from the reality in which we live. People need to grow up and understand this, IMO "

0,"`  :Somewhat. The melody of the verse is in the aeolian mode, which has the same notes as the ``natural minor``. However, when given its usual harmonization the verse modulates from (if it were in the key of E) E minor to G major and back again (the chorus begins in G major and moves back to E), thus the flattened 6th and 7th scale degrees aren't really part of the E natural minor so much as they are part of the G major harmony to which the piece has moved.  :So... overall I would say, no. The piece as usually played falls well within normal tonal practice for the minor mode (modulation to the relative major key). The melody of the verse itself, detached from harmony, however, does fit the aeolian mode (and the lowered 6th and 7th really are noticeable). Though, the aeolian mode wasn't commonly used in western music until relatively late; tonality was not far off when it was finally theorized by Glareanus. -  `"

0,"Recent AfD on Christianity and Judaism ==

Hi! I see that you were one of the participants in the recent AfD on the article Christianity and Judaism.  That AfD recommended (in a snowball result) that the article be merged into Judeo-Christian.  However, since the AfD concerns have been raised, most notably
 Per WP:ADJECTIVE and WP:MOSNAME, we use nouns and noun-phrases for article titles, not adjectives.  So a general survey on the relationships between Christianity and Judaism (a topic this encyclopedia should certainly cover) should be called Christianity and Judaism, as per the articles Christianity and Islam, Islam and Judaism.
 The reason the article Judeo-Christian exists, as its own hatnote declares, is specifically to survey the history and use of that word-phrase  which has its own controversy, and its own tale to tell.  (See here where I've set things out in a bit more detail.)  That story is a good fit for its own article, and will get completely lost if the contents of Christianity and Judaism get inappropriately dumped on top of it.

Having contacted the closing admin, his advice was to open a new discussion at Talk:Christianity and Judaism, advertise the discussion widely, and if a new consensus can be reached in that discussion [his emphasis], then per WP:CCC the new consensus should be followed, rather than the AfD decision, without the need for a DRV or a new AfD.

Concerns about the proposed merge have also been expressed by ,  and .

This post is therefore to let you know that that discussion is underway, at Talk:Christianity and Judaism#Overly speedy deletion, with a view to perhaps setting aside the AfD decision.  

Of course, some significant issues were raised in the AfD about the article in its present form, so the best way forward is a question that needs some thought.  Please feel welcome to come and participate!

Hello, TheOtherStephan, and thanks for your contributions to Wikipedia! 

I wanted to let you know that I’m proposing an article that you worked on, The Giving Plague, for deletion because I don't think it meets our criteria for inclusion. If you don't want the article deleted:

 edit the page
 remove the text that looks like this: {{proposed deletion/dated...}} 
 save the page

It helps to explain why in your edit summary or on the article's talk page. If you have any questions, feel free to ask on the Help Desk. Thanks again for contributing!"
