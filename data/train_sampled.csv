I will not edit it again.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI saw that the article had not been updated with the important closing arguments so I thought to update it.  I guess I should have realised that you owned it, by the way that you reverted everything, with a nasty message to my talk page on top of the reversion, sure signs of ownership.  I took it on face value that really all you wanted were references, as you complained so bitterly about my daring to add in things that you claimed were false.  I mean, you couldn't possibly be trying to damage my reputation just so that you could continue to own the page, could you?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have no problem with a page being owned, HelenOnline, but I really think that at the top of the page it should say ``This article written by .....`` and then it should say your real name.  Then people reading this can account for your biases.  And then, if, let's say, Oscar Pistorius, or Barry Roux, or Gerrie Nel, or someone else, think that what you have added is false, and want to sue you for publishing inaccurate information, then they will know to sue you, HelenOnline, rather than poor old Wikipedia.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI saw that you added a lot of false information to this article, HelenOnline.  Furthermore, I see that you deleted a lot of accurate information, while pretending that it was false.  Most dangerously, you used citations then misquoted what they said.  Very dangerous, that.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs I had said above, I really think that it is safer for you, HelenOnline, to recuse yourself from this article.  You have had major fights with several editors here, which has resulted, in your words, with you ``scaring them off``, as you put it.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI don't know precisely what happened with them, as all I can see are their comments in the talk page above, and looking through the history, but if it anything similar to the abuse I was subjected to, both from you, and by people who blindly support you without bothering to check facts, then I am sure that it was serious.  I got banned for 3 whole days for personal attacks, for asking you to recuse yourself!  Wow!  Just wow!  And as a result, you get to revert my edits unopposed, you get to abuse me all over Wikipedia, I get banned and on top of that the article gets locked in a false state, so that the truth will never be told.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt's on your head, HelenOnline, and everyone who supports you.  This article belongs to you, and if someone decides to sue you, on the completion of the trial on 11 September, I for one won't be held responsible for your false edits.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo goodbye.  Enjoy your control of this article.  It now officially belongs to you.    `"

Yesterday I made some quick changes to the articles for they are obvious not related to Sigibert the Lame. I saw an internetpage that stated they were children of Sigibert II of Austrasia and then highly relectantly changed the text in """"may be Sigibert II"""" to moderate the original claims. However today after consulting Christian Settipani and """"Butler's Lives of the Saints"""" on their supposed nameday I quickly discovered that both don't mention them. So I have deleted the relationship to Sigibert in the articles. Googling the two did not result in any reliable source and I really don't know the two. However there are several placesnames and churches named after Balderic/Baudry both in France and Belgium. The abbey did really exist and I am willing to believe they were actual real persons. Having said that, I have serious doubts if the text of the articles will ever be expanded in something worthwile. So should we keep the articles? Are they worth mentioning in an encyclopedia? I don't have a clue. It's your call.  """

I have only had a chance to have a quick look at what has changed in my absence but the difference is quite significant. Perhaps you believe the article is improved but I believe that important material has been removed and can not think of a justification. For example, the controversy over the Famine Song being sung by Rangers fans is no longer mentioned despite it being described in a court judgement as racist? The fact that Rangers fans continue to be arrested for sectarian singing is not mentioned, leaving the impression that sectarian abuse by fans is no longer an issue? It may not be editors with a pro-Rangers bias who have produced the current version but if you start by looking at the change in the article in only a month, it sure looks like that! Regards   "

 Citation analysis consistent with the critique of the IP editor 

I have no longstanding or longterm interest in contributing to the quality of the article, but have a strong interest in seeing broad, general improvements in the sourcing of scientific articles—including those in the common space between social and biological sciences. And I have an interest in seeing IP editors treated well, by the majority of us, not the few.

The recent visiting IP editor was so set upon by more experienced editors that I thought I would perform a first-pass (rough draft) evaluation of this article, strictly from the perspective of evaluating its sources.

The goals in doing this are three:
(1) To allow us to come to consensus as to the quality of the article, at least in terms of verifiable information (though for this scientist, and for purists such as myself and NeilN, it is likely that if sources should come out, content must also);
(2) To identify patterns of problems, so particular individuals with time and desire might address them (e.g., incomplete therefore unverifiable entries, poor specific sources for particular blocks of information, varyingly formatted similar sources and repeat sources making source followup difficult, etc.), and 
(3) To create a list of first issues to address, so that there might be a common set of priorities (i.e., where the list below might, in months to come, be sprinkled with  markers).

In doing this, I am applying the same academic standards as I might have in reviewing a paper submission from a sixth form or older student, on into university. This is the sort of thing that, while scholarly (so we might each might differ on the details of the analysis), all might agree to the trends represented (and all might have arrived at the same perception within minutes reviewing the article references, and have accomplished a full first-pass evaluation in an hour or so.) That is, we can see for ourselves, instead of taking the a priori position that all is fine enough to remain, or insisting a new editor argue her or his case, thoroughly and decisively, to more seasoned Wikipedia hands.

After having done this evaluation, I have come to the conclusion that the article weaknesses referred to by the IP editor appear to be substantiated. From the persecutive of reliability of information, based on expectation of high quality and verifiable secondary sources suited to the content, I conclude that the article is in very poor condition.

After reviewing this summary of the state of this article's sources, see if you might not agree.

Here, in bullet form, are cogent observations from the evaluation of the article's sourcing:

 >70 references to 12 or more undergraduate textbooks as sources, rather than the scholarly secondary or tertiary sources drawn upon by those texts (see more below);

 >70 references to books that appear without page numbers—King 2008 and King 2009 (47 refs), Buss, Crain (5), Boccadoro (2), Fausto-Sterling, Rathus (3), Russon, Farrell, Coon (2), Escoffier, Al-islam.org, Stearns Major Patterns, Stearns Sexuality (6), Greene;

 47 (36 plus 11) references to the same undergraduate textbook (King, 2008 and 2009), in two entries, all appearing without page numbers;

 More than a half dozen books lacking full citations, particularly, date of publication (e.g., King, Buss, Stearns Major Patterns, Stearns Sexuality), but also, other obscured details (e.g., David Weeks, Secrets of the Superyoung. Berkley., is actually D, Weeks & J. James, 1999, Secrets of the superyoung: The scientific reasons some people look ten years younger than they really are and how you can, too"""", New York:Villard Books, etc.)

 Long articles (> 20 pp) without narrowing part of article sourced via Section name or page number (e.g., Ross, Freud, Nagel, Lee et al, CDC);

 Nonsense page references (e.g., Kim & Ward);

 Many bare URLs or URL-only citations without links (find articles.com, enotes.com, TheAge.com.au, etc.);

 Multiple (>8) references to dead links (facts.org, psychnews.psychiatryonline.org, eehow.com, etc.);

 Many egregiously inappropriate web-based sources, including innerbody.com, about.com, essortment.com, howstuffworks.com (!), proplusmedical.com (male enhancement sales page!), eehow.com, TheAge.com.au, etc.;

 Many further web-based sources for which there are clearly better scholarly sources available — see appearances of Csongradi, oxytocin, innerbody.com, about.com, essortment.com (e.g., on Skinner), CNN.com and HuffPost (on G-spot validity), howstuffworks.com, proplusmedical.com, cwluherstory.org (as source of Anne Koedt article), jrank.org, eehow.com, TheAge.com.au, pop religious web pages for seriou"

 :According to the sources I've found (listed above), your assertion is the wrong way round. A pentagram is a five-pointed star, but a five-pointed star may or may not be a pentagram. for it to be a pentagram (from Greek pentagrammon """"of five lines"""") it needs to be constructed of five lines only, each line crossing two others, so that a star of five points is formed, with a pentagon in the centre ().

 I am glad to report that this article nomination for good article status has been promoted. This is how the article, as of January 21, 2008, compares against the  six good article criteria: 

 ==Good article nomination (3)== 
 I am sorry that this article has failed GAN after being reviewed. Issues on which the decision was based are as follows: 
 :1. Well written?:  
 #:(a) the prose is clear and the grammar is correct.  Pass 
 #:(b) it complies with the manual of style guidelines for lead sections, layout, jargon, words to avoid, and list incorporation. Pass 
 :2. Factually accurate?:  
 #:(a) provides references to all sources of information, and at minimum contains a section dedicated to the attribution of those sources in accordance with the guide to layout, Fail, although the article has many references for its size, many important statements are still unreferenced, e.g. """"Although the powers of the Mayor have diminished over time, the role has retained its importance""""  
 #:(b) provides in-line citations from reliable sources for direct quotations, statistics, published opinion, counter-intuitive or controversial statements that are challenged or likely to be challenged, and Pass 
 #:(c) contains no original research Pass 
 :3. Broad in coverage?:  
 #:(a) addresses the major aspects of the topic; Fail, The article should provide a broader historical background and relate more to the public and local sentiment  
 #:(b) stays focused on the topic without going into unnecessary details (see summary style). fail, example:  
 Civil parishes do not cover the whole of England and mostly exist in rural areas. They are usually administered by parish councils which have various local responsibilities. Parish councillors, like city councillors, are elected to represent the views of local people. Ailsworth, Bainton, Barnack, Borough Fen, Bretton, Castor, Deeping Gate, Etton, Eye, Glinton, Helpston, Marholm, Maxey, Newborough, Northborough, Orton Longueville, Orton Waterville, Peakirk, St. Martin's Without, Southorpe, Sutton, Thorney, Thornhaugh, Ufford, Upton, Wansford, Wittering, and Wothorpe each have a parish council. The city council also works closely with Werrington neighbourhood association which operates on a similar basis to a parish council.[33] Parish elections are held simultaneously on the ordinary day of election of councillors for the district. 
  should be shortened and made more relavent 
 :4. Neutral point of view?:  fail,it does not represents viewpoints fairly and without bias. Please consider rewriting the political control section 
 :5. Article stability? Pass 
 :6. Images?: Very weak pass/fail, the article should include more pictures 

 Requires tackling the mentioned problems above and re-nominating. Many of these issues are minor and can be addressed within a day. If you feel that this review is in error, feel free to take it to Good article reassessment. Thank you to all of the editors who worked hard to bring it to this status, and congratulations."""

More precisely, we tend to edit out misconceptions about Mormon beliefs.  For example, I'm not sure where you got the idea that we believe that elephants once roamed North America or that American Indians were descended from the Jewish race.  The word elephant appears once in the english version of the Book of Mormon, but that may or may not refer to what we currently call elephants.  As for American Indians being a descendent of the Jews (Book of Mormon people), that is also not quite true.  We believe that some of the descendents of the Jews survived the Book of Mormon times, but that may or may not include the American Indians.  It may also include South America as well as various islands.  With all the intermarriage that has happened over the years, finding a ``pure`` blood line would most likely be difficult.

0,"Webcomic notability  

 Hiya! I noticed that you added some webcomics to the big webcomic listings, but unfortunately as they lack an article about them they had to be removed. The only time a webcomic can be added is if it has an article about it or its creator(s) that shows how the webcomic is notable. If you can find enough reliable sources to show that the comics are notable then please feel free to begin creating an article for them, but be aware that it is very, very hard to prove notability for webcomics. I've seen a lot of well-known and very popular webcomics removed because they lacked these sources, such as an article about Dominic Deegan. As far as what is considered a reliable source, you can read over WP:RS, which gives an outline of what is and isn't a reliable source. I just wanted to explain a little more as to why I reverted your additions."

 :Thanks for the advice. And good luck in trying to get an administrator to do anything sensible or appropriate about Eric's appalling behaviour. There is so much bullshit and hypocrisy going on with some of the administrators regarding Eric that it has become absurd and farcical. You may instead, like myself, find yourself receiving a rebuke from an administrator instead of Eric. One administrator has been ignoring Eric's repeated incivility to me and other editors while, in a bullying manner, blaming me and demanding that I withdraw a comment in response to his incivility to me. There is, of course, no way that I am going to withdraw my comment in such circumstances. That really would be hypocritical on my part and rewarding bullies such as Eric. The administrator simply doesn't """"get it"""" and is continuing to make disingenous comments about me whenever s/he has the opportunityy. Eric, meanwhile, seeks pity from other editors over my comment and has been suggesting, falsely and without any evidence whatsoever, of pretending to be a priest and also of being a sockpuppet of some former administrator. The whole situation is very bizarre. Wasn't there once a wise person who said something about seeing a speck in someone else's eye whilst ignoring the beam in your own? All the best.   """

Another Italian veteran discovered

Greetings, Mr. Giovanni Alunni has reported the discovery of another Italian WWI veteran. As I argued in 2004, we should first focus on the 'oldest' veterans, then the 'last.' Only with the deaths in the last year of George Johnson, 112; Maurice Floquet, 111; Ernest Pusey, 111; Moses Hardy, 113; Emiliano Mercado Del Toro, 115; and Antonio Todde, 110 has the focus shifted from 'oldest' to 'last.' Mr. Allingham is all alone from 1896; his chances of being the last veteran are slim to none. Most likely, disappointing or not, the last veteran will be some underage kid who never served in combat and born in 1901 or later. Or just maybe someone from 1900. Given that we have three 109-year-olds in France but no veterans from 1900, I still think it is quite possible that more French WWI vets will be discovered. We will likely see a few more (maybe 1-3) from Italy, Germany, the US, France, and Poland. {yakłtalk} """

I won't try to argue with him because I have had a fruitless argument on the ``life on Mars`` page on this very topic. He is convinced that the cosmic ray arguments that make dormant life impossible over hundreds of thousands of years periods in the surface of Mars also make it impossible for life to survive even if reproducing every year (although cosmic radiation levels on the surface are comparable to the interior of the ISS). I gave up arguing the point with him.  However I'd like to point out that there has been a major conference earlier this year in February (with 38 scientists presenting the results of their researches) [The Present-Day Habitability of Mars 2013 - Program]  You can watch the video presentations and decide for yourself if the current prevailing scientific opinion is that the surface of Mars is potentially habitable or uninhabitable. It is true that before the Phoenix lander possible salty brine observations in 2008 the prevailing view was that life on the surface of Mars is impossible. But that is no longer the consensus and it would be hard to find a single researcher in the field who holds that opinion today. I have put a copy of the section into my user space as I frequently use it for reference and found it a useful resource. Please note I did not write this section myself, only added a couple of sentences to it.  I strongly recommend that it be reinstated.   `"

 == """"Commonly feigned"""" section == 

 Hey, I don't edit wikipedia often so I am sorry if I am doing anything wrong here. But I was just reading this article and I found the section """"Illnesses and conditions commonly feigned by Münchausen patients"""" very offensive. First there's the overlap with psychiatric disorders. If someone repeatedly checks in to the hospital with -big air quotes- DEPRESSION, well, how would saying they are suffering from Münchausen syndrome be any more likely than saying they are suffering from depression? Secondly, there's the fact that the editor himself/herself says """"Many of these conditions do not have clearly observable or diagnostic symptoms."""" I'm pretty sure the hallmark of Münchausen syndrome is that the symptoms are observable but fake - not that they are characteristic of medically difficult problems. I myself have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (""""Myalgic encephalomyelitis"""" as it's billed here), for which science has thus far failed to find any universal testable diagnostic criteria. Since this can't be measured then, does that mean that everyone with CFS and similar conditions is faking it? Of course not. 

 In summary I vote that this entire section be removed. If someone knows the rules (it was flagged in Sept 2010, that's quite a while ago) and could facilitate the process, I'd appreciate it.

0,"`:::What we are creating with Wikipedia is not set in stone. It is an evolving standard defined by what its editors determine to be acceptable, and personally I don't agree with the view that the priority is to write lengthy prose in the style of Encyclopedia Britannica. I've been around since 2007, Jeh has been around since 2005, and Dsimic has been editing a lot since 2013 (in other words, enough to get a very good idea of how Wikipedia's anarchist system works). I'm glad that Jeh prefaced his statement with ``in my opinion`` because that's what Wikipedia is about, and no personal statement (or even an essay such as commonly-cited arguments to avoid essay) is law. We debate a lot. I know just how much sucks but it's the way it is. Now, whether or not product lists are not-so-good articles is (debatably, if you you're axiologically inclined) an empirical and subjective question which could be most reliably answered by surveying our users, or our editors if they're not your priority. In my experience, lists are great for their purpose, and as a power Wikipedia user and editor, I've derived enormous benefit from them - and our users probably derive much more benefit from an article like Comparison of smartphones than the benefit which is derived from, say, the dozens of references I've added to articles like Tort, Trust law, or Economics and hundreds of much lower traffic niche topics. Lists in general are not easy candidates for ``good articles``; as I recall, back around 2008 or so there was a campaign by a couple people to to delete a lot of list articles on that basis and on the duplication with categories, but when I pointed to WP:CSL, the steam was taken out even though that didn't change the sensibility of the decisions.  In any case, you are welcome to boldly make and advocate for changes, and I reserve the right to express my own opposition within the limits of my available free time. ) :::As an aside, I mention the views of users seriously - it has been pretty well empirically shown that oldtimers like myself are actively hostile to newcomers (as documented by Aaron Halfaker (). I'm pretty sure most prospective editors are more bothered by the detailed and voluminous rules than maintaining the style of an old-school encyclopedia. I realize I'm channeling this a bit myself in my approach here, but oh well!  |  -    `"

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWe have to keep in mind that the fabrication of photographs back in 1963 was still rather primitive.

See, for example Warren Commission Ex 746-C with the face pasted on at the level of the chin. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt was also a wise choice not to use Exhibit 749 because it has that embarrassing oversight where someone drew in what appeared to be the butt of the gun stock for another photograph and re-used it with the triangular piece of gun stock still drawn in.

0,"`  == Canadian Football League - nope == He does not show up on any all time CFL team roster. Same for the Raiders of the NFL. He does have a football card for the 1991 San Antonio Riders, so he probably played for them.   ==Controversy flaw== JBL using racial slurs isn't actually controversial. It's part of his gimmick. It shouldn't be part of the controversy section.    *JBL's racial slurs as part of his gimmick are controversial.  Just because they're scripted does not make them non-controversal.  Further, JBL's comments are controversal just as the Cryme Tyme gimick has been controversial, too.  *The controversial section needs some cleaning up. Where's the objectivity? Most of it assumes him as racist by making no dissemination between his personal beliefs, and his gimmick.    ==mess== i'm gonna clean up the last paragraph in the 2006 section, as it is written with alot of broken english that is difficult to understand.  http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile;=THEAPA.jpg appears as red, the photo does not exist on the page   == Judgment Day == should it be noted under a trivia uestion that the last 3 years in a row JBL was in a main event match for a world title at Judgement day (04 he faced Eddie Guerrero, 05 he faced John Cena, and in 06 he faced Rey Mysterio)  == Anyone know the date of his WWF debut? == The best I can find is December 1995 as John Hawk against Savio Vega (http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/95.htm). Is that right.@   == Nicknames == Should a section be added with ``Wrestling God`` put there? I'm not sure if he's had any other nicknames or if it's notable enough. But it would seem so, other articles (see Triple H) list them.   :I don't think we should. Triple H has had multiple nicknames, 3 of which he still uses. Layfield used only that one, he used it sparingly, he was almost never called ``Wrestling God`` by other superstars or commentators, and he has not used it in years. ( )  == Powerbomb? == I've never seen JBL do a powerbomb. Why is it listed? Because it's his finisher in SmackDown! vs. RAW 2007 or what?!  Emilos  Erased.     == In Ring Return == I think we should call him a SEMI-RETIRED wrestler, as he returned to in-ring competition on Raw last night, and he actually wrestled.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by   •    :He did not wrestle though, he helped beat up Coach and Carlito. The match was just Hornswoggle vs. Coach and Carlito (it was no DQ, thats why the APA could interfere).    ::WWE.com announced his in-ring return.     == Return To Active Duty == It seems we've been entertaining a bit of looking into the crystal ball, here. JBL returns tonight on Smackdown, but until that show airs, it's not official unless it's properly referenced somewhere else (WWE.com or another reliable source).     == Well this ultimately proved to be false... == In ``Semi-Retirement / WWE Commentator (2006-2007)``...  ``Layfield noted in a recent commentary on TheStreet.com that he was retiring from in-ring competition for good...``  ``A broken back suffered in a match in England, compounded by a herniated and bulged disc, finally made me realize my career as a professional wrestler was over.``  Yet he returns a year and a half later  Should these comments be retained?      == World Champion == Not sure how "

Facts are usually represented by the data with which we deal when engaged in experimentation and observation.  Yes, rules and ideas are tested.  Theories are tested.  They are all tested against the data - the facts as we have gathered them.  It's a fact that people don't rocket off into space when they jump up from a trampoline.  Theories about gravity serve to explain that fact.  It's a fact that organic life on this planet is interrelated and evolved over billions of years.  The various theories of evolution explains that fact.  -      `"

0,"  The Supreme Court is completely independent, and was designed that way. The only time that any partisanship has an influence is when the confirmations are taking place.  So tell me, how exactly can any President, party, or politician have ANY influence over a member in the Supreme Court? What can they do? The Justice is nominated for LIFE. What could any party or politician possibly offer to a sitting Supreme Court Justice, when that Justice has a guaranteed job no matter who's in power, and no matter what their decision is?  Think about the 2000 election for a second. What did the Justices who voted to stop the recount (let's remember that the case wasn't about the Supreme Court voting for one candidate or another....if you really think that, please reread the decision) have to gain from doing so? What motive could Justice Scalia and then Chief Justice Rehnquist possibly have in ensuring that one party or another, or one president or another, came to power? Do you know what would have happened to all the sitting ""conservative"" Justices if Gore had won instead? NOTHING. So how did the party have any influence over their decision?"

Further, no guidelines-based reason has been given for removal of the see also.  According to WP:SEEALSO, ``The links in the ``See also`` section should be relevant, should reflect the links that would be present in a comprehensive article on the topic, and should be limited to a reasonable number.``  The see also I added complies with this fully.  The title (topic) of the section where the see also was added is ``Notable alumni``, which is straightforwardly translated to ``People attending this metro area high school``.  In the vast majority of cases, people who attend a high school are from the area the high school is in.  Therefore, it is reasonable that List of people from the Louisville metropolitan area be shown as a see also. Further, similar reverts were done on other high school articles based on ``consensus`` that was merely a disagreement between two editors, meaning those reverts used an openly dishonest rationale.   •  `"

has the community not gotten smaller? 
was it not caused by the automobile? 
have I not sourced the statement as asked? 
is it not a fact? 
is it not information? 
does it not help inform people as to why foresters falls is not as large as it seemingly once was? 
is it not the only peice of information in the article that bridges the span of time between 1870 and present? 
is the usfullness of the edit the only criteria used to determine if it will be reverted or not?

and I'll just go ahead and add:

Why it is better to not have the statement than to have it?
Does this information not answers a pertinant question left open by the article?
If I were to refrase the sentance would that be better? 
What criteria was used to determine that it should be removed?
Why insist on the removal of this perfectly sensible statement?

I'll also go ahead and post this on the disscussion board for Forsters Falls aswell.

If you could try to treat me like a person and just respond to this post that would be great. Wouldn't you want to get a response? and if you can not, in any way, justify the edit perhaps you should consider the possibility that it was infact not justified and as such should be reverted. maybe? maybe any human can make mistakes?

Your leaning upon claims of 'good faith' as a defence against being reverted for doing something that is wrong is not only utterly irrelevant but intellectually dishonest.

A sample of the other articles are as follows:  |Chinese creation myth  |Sumerian creation myth  |Ancient Egyptian creation myths  |Pelasgian creation myth  |Tongan creation myth  |Mesoamerican creation myths  |Creation Myth  |Keeping in mind that this isn't a case of WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS since WP:WTA makes a specific example for uniform usage and the usage of ``Creation Myth`` is clearly the dominant usage for Religious and Supernatural cosmogenical articles.  |*WP:RNPOV  |Usage of ``Creation Myth`` is clearly in line with this policy. The policy states ``Wikipedia articles on history and religion draw from a religion's sacred texts as well as from modern archaeological, historical, and scientific sources.`` The latter three almost unanimously use the term ``Creation Myth`` while the first describes it as a historical fact (which we cannot due for a myriad of reasons that I'm sure everyone reading this understands).  |At best if any reliable sources can be found that are critical of usage of the term ``Creation Myth`` (not myth as a stand alone since the Electoral College can not be classified as a College any more than definitions of myth, particularly the informal/colloquial definitions can be applied to the term ``Creation Myth``) a section disucssing this criticism should be added to the article and the main Creation Myth article but shouldn't contradict usage of the term per ``Some adherents of a religion might object to a critical historical treatment of their own faith because in their view such analysis discriminates against their religious beliefs. Their point of view must be mentioned if it can be documented by notable, reliable sources, yet note that there is no contradiction.``  |Per the section that states ``Several words that have very specific meanings in studies of religion have different meanings in less formal contexts, e.g. fundamentalism and mythology. Wikipedia articles about religious topics should take care to use these words only in their formal senses in order to avoid causing unnecessary offense or misleading the reader.`` editors of this article have, in good faith, created a FAQ, cited formal definitions, wikilinked to the main Creation myth article (which also has a detailed formal definition) and added a footnote to the the term ``Creation Myth`` to further clarify formal usage. All of which meet and possibly exceed the due diligence required to ensure that the formal meaning is understood.  |*WP:UCN  |Usage of ``Creation Myth`` in the title has been furthermore contested after the first article RM, another RM was started about a week later to remove the term from the title, that RM also was declined and closed (albeit with some arguement and complaint regarding it possibly being closed too soon). UCN tells us ``Articles are normally titled using the most common English-language name of the subject of the article. In determining what this name is, we follow the usage of reliable sources, such as those used as references for the article``, considering the vast majority of cited sources including archaelogical, scientific, historical and other scholarly/academic writings use the term ``Creation Myth`` as opposed to other colloquial variants the title meets UCN.  |Furthermore the usage of ``Creation Myth`` abounds in reliable sources doing a quick google search shows that it's use clearly meets the ``common usage`` section of UCN ``Common usage in reliable sources is preferred to technically correct but rarer forms, whether the official name, the scientific name, the birth name, the original name or the trademarked name``  UCN also tells us ``Where articles have descriptive titles, they are neutrally worded. A descriptive article title should describe the subject without passing judgment, implicitly or explicitly, on the subject. `` alternatives such as ``Story`` or ``account`` imply value judgements regarding veracity one way or the other (Story commonly being defined as fiction, account commonly being used in factual / historical context). Additionally changing the name causes a loss of precision (also discussed in UCN) since ``Creation Myth`` is the formally defined academic term and as such doesn't allow for any ambiguity (only one definition) whereas other alternatives do.  |Some editors have brought up di"

0,"Participant alert regarding Wikiproject on Advertising
The Wikiproject No Ads, created as a backlash against the Answers.com deal, has served an important function in providing a space for users to express their disagreement with the Foundation proposal. While the current controversies about userboxes raise questions about political and social advocacy on Wikipedia, there should be greater flexibility regarding advocacy about Wikipedia in the Wikipedia namespace. Reported and linked by Slashdot and other press sources as a unique and spontaneous occurence in Wikipedia history, it has apparently had some impact as, despite being scheduled to begin in January, not a peep has been heard about the trial and proposed sponsored link since the deal's controversial announcement months ago. Currently, however, there is an attempt to delete the project or move it off Wikipedia altogether. Since the Foundation has provided no additional information and has not attempted to answer the specific questions that participants in the project raised, it is unclear if the Answers.com deal has been abandoned or simply delayed. Until the situation becomes more clear, I believe the group should still have a place in the Wikipedia namespace. Sincerely,"

Anyone who is LGBT but doesn’t dress like everyone else or talks about LGBT issues has always been told they’re “basing their identity on being gay” regardless of how many other interests they may have.

It is true there are some hardware problems with the X-Fi lines (some, like the infamous SCP, were actually carried on from the Live! and Audigy series), others are more critical and unique to X-Fi (e.g. outright defective firmware  on some batches, resulting in totally unusable cards) but independent backing up for each of these facts is needed. And surely openly endorsing another manufacturer isn't in Wikipedia's style. Here's the removed excerpt:  :====The 'Squeal of Death' problem==== :A great many Creative customers have suffered from an intermittent fault known colloquially as the  Squeal of Death'. This manifests as a high pitched whine or squeal which plays constantly until the computer is rebooted. It manifests on many high performance PCs. The X-FI card appears to be incompatible with NVidia SLI based systems and with ASUS motherboards.  :Creative have failed to fix the problem, directing blame at the motherboard manufacturers. Users report that replacing the Creative card with a rival such as the Razer Barracuda card cures the problem. The 'Squeal of Death' only affects Creative Labs products.

I've noticed that as well. That's actually what confuses me the most: If it really is a single, why can't I buy it anywhere? Honestly, I think that if people write it as a """"single"""", they don't really care if it isn't available separately; simply calling something a single doesn't specify whether it's promo or not. For people trying to cater to consumers, like Billboard.com reviews, if it's a popular hit and/or music video, people know it; it doesn't matter under what technical details it was released. But I think the difference is that since we are able to specify this, we probably should. We should try to reflect the reality. I don't think having a music video and a high placement in charts does anything to change the type of single it is; I've seen music videos for promo singles many times before; even some for album tracks. Isn't it a promo single nevertheless if it's only available separate from the album for promotional purposes? It's not like this is degrading the single in any way either; some artists just don't release subsequent album singles separately for consumers because they'd rather prefer they buy the album.   """

Most of the last edit seems to belong to the talk page rather than in the article, so I have moved it so I can be discussed.

Broader context
Use of the term """"psychoanalytic theory"""" implies that there is a core theory which is complete by itself.  This view is not common even among practicing analysts, who in large part recognise that the mind is a function of the brain, so that any full theory of the psyche needs to refer to the brain.  An excellent review of this is Kandel ER (1999) """"Biology and the future of psychoanalysis"""", Am.J.Psychiat 156:505.

Psychoanalytic thinking is inseparably bound also to clinical treatment of patients.  Some purists claim that achieving insight is the only goal of psychoanalysis; but health insurers generally require more concrete goals such as reduced mental illness or increased time at work.  Both of these clinical perspectives assume that the effect on actual patients is important  so they should be included in this article.  An excellent review of the clinical benefits of psychoanalysis is Fonagy, Roth & Higgitt (2005), Bull.Menninger Clinic 69(1):1-58.

This article would not be complete without consideration of substantial attacks on psychoanalysis and its theory, which have reshaped psychiatric practice in the UK and USA over the past 20-30 years.  These attacks can be classified as empirical (Gabbard, Gunderson & Fonagy 2002); financial (Detre & McDonald 1997); theoretical (Meehl 1998 calculates that there are many psychoanalytical explanations possible for any single clinical problem); and circumstantial (e.g. past failures with respect to homosexuality and childhood abuse, and the antipathy of many analysts to quantitative research:  Gabbard, Gunderson & Fonagy 2002).

Psychoanalytic theorists may have over-reached themselves in attempting to account for all troublesome psychic phenomena.  However, their concerted efforts to address more circumscribed areas have produced widely acknowledged, influential advances in the areas of defense mechanisms, attachment, the unconscious, transference and counter-transference, and the treatment of borderline personalities, among others.  Each of these advances has been accompanied by individual theories.

Suggestions for the peer-review
The article should not require a paragraph to describe what it is about; instead, its scope should simply be theories to do with psychoanalysis.  It should include subsections on the question of whether (and how) psychoanalysis can be studied objectively, whether it is disproveable in whole or part (and whether this matters), the informal """"theory"""" of the manners in which analysis can be conducted (e.g. bare room unlike Freud; methods of interpretation), and the relationships with behavioural, cognitive, and psychiatric theories.  It would be useful to have an explanation of why psychoanalysis has resisted decline so much more successfully in France than in anglophone countries.  Rather than complicated sentences with complicated words, we should be treated to simple descriptions of the differences between Freudian, Jungian, and Adlerian thinking.  Possibly in lists if that helps to simplify the sentences."""

 For those not interested in reading the links, it appears that they posit a theory of linguistic evolution that was dependent on psilocybin-containing mushrooms.

 Yeah I think general summaries are ok as long as they are actual summaries of multiple authors, aren't just mere repetitions of the author's statement and don't elongate the paragraph more unnecessarily. Also I'll like to point out these mistakes in your comment:
""""2) per Eliade, approximative understanding, partly of apparently non-Arabian rites, so not much;""""
Eildae never says it was non-Arabian. She's talking about Monophysite rites and Monophysite was the largest branch of Christianity in Arabia.

 """"3) per Watt, details that may be surmised by close analysis Muhammad's life;""""
He also argues that these verses might be attacking Christian heresies rather than orthodox beliefs. 

Also in the final I'll like to say again the subject of the article isn't about Quran and it's historicity and interpretations. So adding more and more unnecessary arguments and interpretations makes the paragraph stray too far from the topic and unnecessarily elongates the paragraph with needless irrelevant text.   """

 * Vidalia, Georgia micropolitan area →  
 * Glasgow, Kentucky micropolitan area →  
 – State names are properly set off with commas on both sides.  Article titles must still be grammatical, notwithstanding the inexplicable comment above that """"the second-comma concern applies to prose, not article titles"""".    
 *Oppose both. The grammar with two commas suggests that Vidalia and Glasgow are micropolitan areas, which is not what is meant. With one comma, there is a micropolitan area centered on Vidalia and Glasgow, which is the meaning used. A review of the cats involved shows that one comma is used for this type of article, such as Jacksonville, Illinois micropolitan area.    
 **Your interpretation of the meanings denoted by the two punctuation options is idiosyncratic at best.  The state name is delimited by commas because it is an interruption to the regular flow of the phrase.  Much like one would say """"the British style of government"""" or """"New York state of mind"""", we have a noun phrase (""""micropolitan area"""") being modified by a location (""""Vidalia"""") to form a descriptive phrase (""""Vidalia micropolitan area"""").  It's an area named for or identified by the community """"Vidalia"""".  The state name, here, is used as it is in running prose: """"The man said he was from the Tupelo, Mississippi, area.""""  One would not say """"... from the Tupelo, Mississippi area"""", because one is not talking of a """"Mississippi area"""".  Likewise, we are not speaking of a """"Georgia micropolitan area""""; we're talking of a micropolitan area named for """"Vidalia, Georgia"""".  Thus, the commas are necessary, just as they would be in running prose.     
 *Support both per WP:Copyedit mentioned in the previous RM above.    
 *Weak support seems better

Aleppo central prison liberated
http://sana.sy/eng/21/2014/05/22/546092.htm

Damascus, (SANA) Army units successfully wrapped up military operations in the vicinity of Aleppo Central Prison after they had broken the siege on the troops defending it, the General Command of the Army and Armed Forces said.

In a statement issued Thursday, the Command announced that army units have regained control over a site where a law-enforcement battalion is stationed north of the prison and tightened grip on the adjacent areas, inflicting back-breaking losses on the armed groups.

""""The new achievement is highly important as it serves to tighten the noose on residual terrorist groups in the eastern and northeastern outskirts of Aleppo city and cuts off supply lines that terrorist gangs were using for movement from the [Aleppo] northern countryside towards the city,'' added the statement.

The statement lauded the feat as a """"body blow"""" for terrorist gangs which used Aleppo northern countryside as a springboard to launch attacks against Aleppo city, adding that it """"gives the lie to claims and fabrications"""" about terrorist groups seizing control of the prison.

The Command concluded by vowing non-stop efforts to strike terrorists hard and bring back security and stability to Aleppo """"and every inch of the Syrian land.""""

0,"RAF and Commonwealth pilots all wore seat-type parachutes which fitted into the standard pilot's bucket seat, whilst the other crew members all wore chest-fitted removable parachutes. The parachute pack clipped-on to the harness at the front (chest) and only needed to be attached immediately before jumping. For confined rear turrets the pack was sometimes stored outside the turret in the fuselage, the gunner only needing to reach behind him to open the two rear doors of the turret and reach into the fuselage. Where the tail gunner stowed his parachute depended on personal preference and to some extent, on his physical size.  :::The internal dimensions of the Lancaster and its turrets was somewhat wanting in terms of space, as when the basic aircraft had been designed (as the Manchester) the normal flying clothing was limited to perhaps a Sidcot suit and a parachute. With the increasing later use of such apparel as Irvin jackets and Mae Wests and other impedimenta the average crew member became a much bulkier figure, leading to difficulties in exiting the aircraft in an emergency, the dimensions of the escape hatches remaining unchanged. This possibly accounts for the higher crew losses for the Lancaster compared to the Halifax, which was also much roomier inside.  "

 == The issue appears only to be the old uncited/needsmore tags == 

 Summary: 
 The beatings of this article will continue until editor morale improves and they start citing everything that I am demanding, and I will continue to delete large swaths of this article's content, regardless of its correctness, of which I know nothing about, until my demands are met. Policy is on my side so you demoralized editors who feel you are being unfairly treated by me have no recourse except to bow down to my will, or see your work on this subject matter mercilessly ripped to pieces by me and the might of my deletionist hammer (backed by bureaucratic policy of course). Hahaha! Neener neener neener! 

 As unpaid editors contributing good faith high-quality technical edits of their own free time, some editors may feel that being repeatedly """"shouted at"""" and """"called on the carpet"""" by an overbearing and unrelenting managerial deletionist *******, they find it rather difficult to spur the motivation to comply to the deletionist's every whim. 

  

 The solution to this current debate seems rather simple. A knowledgeable editor such as Spinningspark merely needs to look at some of the cites already included in the article, and declare the cites included already fully cover the entire breadth of the article, and thus remove all such uncited/needsmore tags, perhaps inserting a few new ones for just specific sections. 

 Doniago is unable to dispute removal of said needsmore/refneeded tags because it has already demonstrated it knows nothing of this subject matter other than the presence of said tags. 

 Doniago who knows nothing of this subject matter and apparently does not care to involve itself in such matters such as actually knowing anything about the topic, and merely narrowly focusing on old cleanup tags, without knowing the meaning of either the text or the cites, is now left with nothing to do because all the old refneeded/needsmore tags are removed except find another article to start vandalizing in the name of """"improvement"""". 

 (Like player piano maybe?  oops, sorry, Doniago is already busy deletionist vandalizing that one, another narrow technical topic of little-dispute but alas not well cited and (gasp) needsmore tags more than (gasp) six months old, so it DEMANDS the heavy-handed Doniago to delete ANY further additions if uncited, ever. I was going to start expanding and improving it but after some run-ins with Doniago he took all the fun out of even trying to start improving it.. so **** it, the article can rot.) 

  

 Cites? Yes, eventually. If it's a real problem for you personally, you are certainly free to add them if you actually care to learn anything of the subject matter. 

 However, deleting what you don't understand in a technical subject matter article simply due to the presence of a old refneeded tag seems rather unproductive and divisive, and unlikely to get the quality results you are arrogantly demanding of the other unpaid volunteer editors of the article. 

 And yes, I know we're supposed to discuss the topic, not the editors, but this really is a lot about Doniago's deletionism attitude and demeanor, which reminds me more of a schoolyard bully than an adult editor contributing to the knowledge enhancement of millions of people. 

 Doniago makes no attempt to either cite or verify anything, it only deletes based on the presence of aged cleanup tags, which may themselves be of dubious placement by people who also don't understand the subject matter. 

 Doniago's editing methods do not inspire camaraderie and cooperation with other technical subject matter editors, who are most likely going to continue trying improve and cite these articles, even after Doniago has moved on to some new article to flog. 

  
 When we have other uninvolved bureaucrats come in and say But he does have policy on his side it is exactly like some schoolyard bully running to tell on the other kids and then triumphantly smirking while seeing the other kids get in trouble. It makes for a very divisive and abrasive working environment. The other kids just want to reach through TCP/IP and whack said bully with a large trout. 

     

 : Ooops, my mistake. According to policy, you don't need to declare to anyone here that you know anything about a topic to edit it. We don't care about degrees or experience. 

 : So rather than requiring some editor known to be knowledgeable of the topic to remove citeneeded tags, we really only just need some random anonymous IP editor to decide the article is cited well enough (even if they don't understand the article at all) and remove al"

 == Trustworthiness ==  

 I think the section on trustworthiness misses the point.  The point it seems to make is """"this should not work at all, but it kinda looks like it seems like it might, at least so far, so meh.""""  Not exactly a ringing endorsement. 

 I would argue it will work, and it will be trustworthy, and that this type of system has been under test for about 4 billion years.  Life evolved to the working examples that it is through random mutation and natural selection.  Wikis evolve through (usually) non-random and intelligent mutation and (usually) intelligent selection based on facts.  So it should not only work as well as evolution, it should work far better and far faster.  Just like there are people who assume evolution will not work, there are people who will assume a Wiki will not work, and probably for the same reasons (well, other than religion)  because it seems complicated an esoteric with so much seemingly left to freedom and chance, when in fact the wikis are constantly selected back to the facts.  There may be some messiness and missteps along the way, but both systems will eventually arrive at working solutions. 

 I suppose, however, that at any given instant a wiki could have been vandalized and not fixed yet, so thus untrustworthy.  Unlikely, but quite possible.  So, perhaps the original section would be accurate, barring some technological solution.  Like coloring any change that is less than 24 hours old, or not reviewed or something.  Meh.

If someone did the same about Jehovah's Witnesses books, you would be outraged, disgusted, and we would never hear the end to it, you definitely would not stand for it. You would also have utmost contempt for someone who makes up lies, false accusations, and slander about JWs and their books, especially if they had never even read a single JW publication and yet they posted masses of negative claims about them, just like you have about Raymond Franz.

Sometimes he makes useful edits, such as adding interwikis to the Catalan Wikipedia but most of his edits are small, difficult to detect vandalism to Spain-related pages, and since those pages get little traffic it takes very long until his changes are reverted... Take this diff as an example of his bad edits:  changed ``country`` from Spain to Catalonia (?) in the infobox. Or this one: . There are many more, just check them yourself. He also typically removes the .es from official URL and changes it to a DNS alias like .net. He knows very little English so he rarely edits sentences in articles.

 Paul Harvey 

Hi, there! Concerning your request for protection of Paul Harvey and allowing only certain people access to the page, such an action is impossible with the MediaWiki software, as protection would block out every user but administrators. Also, while I understand your concerns over the article, there are bits of policy that have become standard, and while I mean no offense, it is in fact discouraged that PR firms edit the articles of people or organizations they represent (see WP:AUTO) due to concerns that a potential conflict of interest in one's editing could result in a non-neutral point of view, which is often remedied by the edits of uninvolved, neutral editors without an opinion over a piece. I'm going to see if I can find someone else to expand on this a little bit more, but on the mean time I will add the article to my watchlist and revert any vandalism or additions of unsourced material to help out, per WP:BIO.

0,"Hi, Benne. Thank you for unearthing this need for disambiguation. I think that Mansura is usually spelled with a ta marbuta as its final letter: منصورة (manṣūrä). This comes frot the root نصر (naṣara) meaning 'help' or 'make victorious' (interestingly, in derived form II it means 'Christianize'). Therefore, منصور (manṣūr) means 'helped', 'supported', 'victorious'. The place name is the feminine version of this, perhaps representing the old accusative (with locative meaning). In Arabic, many place names begin with the definite article. Sometimes the article is kept in trasliteration and sometimes it isn't. Sometimes it's transliterated as Al and sometimes it's El. The word itself could be transliterated as Mansura, Mansoura, Mansoora, Mansurah, Mansourah, Mansoorah, Mansureh, Mansoureh, Mansooreh. It would make sense to have all of these alternatives, with and without alternatives of definite article, linking to a disambiguation page. However, the Egyptian Mansurah is by far the most important of these, so it might take precedence over the disambig. I'll see if I can tidy it up a little. —"

0,"  == balance  ==  The making of humanity Robert Briffault Publisher G. Allen & Unwin ltd., 1919 Original from the University of California Digitized Oct 18, 2007  It must be admitted that, in recoil from the general conspiracy of silence of our histories, several writers who have sought to vindicate the claims of Arab culture have somewhat exaggerated the achievements of Arabian science. Against such loose panegyrics it has been objected, that Arab science produced no surpassing genius and no transcending discovery ; that it was derived from extraneous sources. That is substantially true, but entirely irrelevant. Arab astronomy did not forestall Copernicus or Newton, though without it there would have been no Copernicus and no Newton. Although the complexity of the Ptolemaic system was repeatedly criticized by Moorish astronomers, although Al-Zarkyal declared the planetary orbits to be ellipses and not circles, although the orbit of Mercury is in Al-Farani's tables actually represented as elliptical, although Muhammad Ibn Musa glimpsed in his works on Astral Motion and The Force of Attraction the law of universal gravitation, those adumbrations of the truth were not fruitful of any great reform. The only important facts brought to light by Arabian astronomy, the discovery of the movements of the sun's apogee by Al-Batani, and of the secondary variations of the moon's motion by Abu '1-Wafa, exercised no perceptible influence upon the course of research, and had to be rediscovered by Tycho. Ibn Sina is said to have employed an air thermometer, and1 Ibn Yunis certainly did use the pendulum for the measurement of time ; but neither of those devices, which were independently re- introduced by Galileo, can be counted as a contribution to the growth of science.  That, however, is entirely beside the point. The debt of our science to that of the Arabs does not consist in startling discoveries or revolutionary theories; science owes a great deal more to Arab culture, it owes its existence. The ancient world was, as we saw, pre-scientific. The astronomy and mathematics of the Greeks were a foreign importation never thoroughly acclimatized in Greek culture. The Greeks systematized, generalized and theorized, but the patient ways of investigation, the accumulation of positive knowledge, the minute methods of science, detailed and prolonged observation, experimental inquiry, were altogether alien to the Greek temperament. Only in Hellenistic Alexandria was any, approach to scientific work conducted in the ancient classical world. What we call science arose in Europe as a result of a new spirit of inquiry, of new methods of investigation, of the method of experiment, observation, measurement, of the development of mathematics in a form unknown to the Greeks. That spirit and those methods were introduced into the European world by the Arabs.  Is  Briffault's writing wp:npov? Not when cut and pasted, only when taken in context. The emphasis in this quote is mine, however wp:rs will show that systems and theories of science in the middle ages are those of Aristotle, Archimedes, Galen, Ptolemy, and Euclid. As for the spirit and methods we need a more neutral tone. :  "
1,"Fuck Babylon and fuck you  
 Yeah that's right. You filthy worthless fucking shill. You are what is wrong with the world. You are the person who will lie, who will aid in the misinformation of millions, for a buck. Whatever they are paying you, I'm sure it's not much, people like you are cheap. I curse you, Yellow up. Certainly I curse Babylon and their bullshit invasive malware, but first and foremost I cure YOU. You are a single person who has dedicated themselves to aiding and propagating Babylon's cancer. I'm singling you out. May you suffer the accumulated cost and stress incurred by your master's malware. One day, when you have truly been stung by something that was not as it seemed, when you are stressed out of your mind and truly personally fucked- may you raise no fist to the air, for this is but a fraction of what you deserse. You snivelling evil little piece of shit. You are an embarrassment. An embarrassment to the human race, and common decency, and an embarrassment to your family. Go on, call your mother right now and ask her if she is proud of what you do? Ask her if she is happy the child she raised now spreads lies for a harmful company for pathetically small sums of money. She doesn't know, of course, because you haven't told her. You are ashamed of yourself and you fucking well should be. You, and the company who whores you out, are a stain on the brilliant face of israeli entrepreneurship- you will never stand proudly in a country so rich in honest and competitive entrepreneurs. You are the scum of Israel, and you are the scum of the internet. 

 Deep inside of all of us there is a child. A child that once dreamed of doing great things, being a good person, and improving the world. You have failed that inner child, Yellow up. You commit yourself to pathetic shameful work, are a bad person, and help to make the world a worse place by making it more difficult for other people. I would appeal to you to change your ways, to make up for this bullshit by maybe doing something to help others- but people like you never change. Truly. It sounds crazy, but without a doubt it is dishonest people who are the most reviled, unpopular, lonely figures. Think about it, people can be vain, violent, ugly, rude, timid, drunk, arrogant, or hysterical, and still have friends who overlook their flaws. Liars? Nobody is truly friends with someone they know to be a liar. They are social scum, tolerated at best, spoken ill of when not present. The romantic partners of liars grow to resent them, often leaving. The dishonest grow old lonely, resented by any family that still tolerates them, avoided by everyone else who can. They never change, either. You are one of these people, Yellow up. A peddler in untruth.  

 When you delete this, just as your finger hits the 'delete' button, I want you to realise it is because you are deeply ashamed of yourself. That a part of your dishonest piece of shit little self doesn't want people to know what you are. Taste that realisation and savour it. Also note that I haven't wished you death; it's not a nice thing to do. If you truly come to comprehend how revolting of a person you really are (and I doubt it), don't kill yourself. The least you owe the world is to compensate and do something to improve it, try to make this place better for a change.  

 I hope you spill coffee all over your nice shirt. Next time you spill shit on your shirt, think of me, and this, and what a deceitful little shit you are."

1,"Jews just have a good programmer.  They are fucking retarded! Jews are retarded. This is a simple fact. But how did they get this way? Contrary to populate belief, Jews are actually not smart at all! In fact they are brainwashed retarded monkeys and are easily manipulated and in reality, they have no intelligence at all. This does not include the Fake Jew elite but your average Jew or at least a person who thinks they are a Jew but are really not. A Jew is completely programmed just like a brainwashed retarded Democrat but with a twist.  Democrats are merely a software program, and so are Jews.  If looking at the average IQ of Israel being 95, that means the vast majority of Jews are just simply retarded and easily manipulated. The higher IQ Jews are the ones who have been manipulated tremendously.  There may be a few Jews that actually have intelligence, but they probably go along with the ruse that they are superior.  Their lack of ethical behavior overall precludes them from stopping all the misdeeds that they perpetuate on humanity. Since the masses literally have no intelligence, this includes the Jew also. Jews are vastly overrepresented in academia, and when that is the case, pretty much they all are retarded.  Doctors, Lawyers and obviously University professors are complete blithering idiots where all they can do is memorize, not think.  Jews are very good at memorization, but not thinking.  Intelligence is not regurgitation. Never has been, Never will be. What makes the difference for when a Jew is programmed, they are programmed to think they are superior. This makes them extremely confident.  They are also programmed to be the nicest individuals as they are gregarious and appear to be totally in control.  They will lie incessantly without remorse which is no different than a Democrat.  They will not actually know they are lying either. But they are programmed to take advantage to all gentiles because “They are the chosen ones” Thus, it is not a problem nor is it a sin to make sure Gentiles are pushed down.  Gentiles are programmed to take it and the vast majority do unless they are awake. The programming states that gentiles are lessor beings and should be slaves to their superior being.  They are not, as this is just their programming. Thus, just like Democrats, Jews are controlled entirely, and if they are controlled, you can twist their minds just like a Democrat. It just requires a different set of rules. Rules: They are simple. Include the cult phrases that are typical of Democrats, but apply them to organizations they support.  This will stump them and they will not have a response.   Remember, they do not have intelligence, but the programming is extremely confident coupled with the inalienable right of deceit.  This is what makes a Jew a Jew or should a say fake Jew. None of them are really Jewish, they are merely programmed to believe they are."

0,"  ==In defense of the old portrait==  It is a pity that, having so many portraits of Peter III, the article is illustrated by a coin. The coin is contemporaneous, but the portrait is simple and non descriptive.  However, the portrait of the Nuova Cronica is more adequate. Offers an image of the King, is the most old portrait of him in Commons (was painted only two or three decades after his death) and has resemblance to the true face of the King (recently reconstruced by computer using his skull) and shows real characteristics of his appearance (Peter III dyed his hair to blonde, which justifies that in the portrait the king appears with blond hair and brown beard).

(Enjoying to spend time with one's father and/or brother while despising one's Mother and/or sister, and the other way around).  2.  Which gender they are most accepted and which they are most rejected by.  (Friendship vs. Bullying)  3.  What activities they have access to and enjoy most.  (Ex:  Having little sports equipment to play with but lots of dolls vs. having a lot of sports equipment to play with but few dolls.)  4.  Some biological factors which form a sort of basis for everything else. (Ex: The brain develops more masculine or less masculine characteristics).  5.  Personal success vs. personal failure (Being more successful at an activity vs. failing at it would likely result in one enjoying or despising the activity and thus, be more or less inclined to do them). And finally,  6.  The behaviors as a result of the above and how they affect what happens with them.  (Ex:  Acting more or less typical of gender role will affect how others react to you and in turn, how you react to them, further altering one's behavior and creating a sort of cycle.)  I also believe these factors affect how one reacts to the genders (accepting and rejecting stereotypes, as well what gender one prefers to spend time with) and even one's behavior in general but, that's another matter entirely.  Yes, I know I have no citations, but this is what I derived from personal experience and a little common sense.  Even if this is true, I have no idea where to get the citations for this. "

0,"What Makes Muscles Grow? (Transcrição) Muscles. We have over 600 of them. They make up between 1/3 and 1/2 of our body weight, and along with connective tissue, they bind us together, hold us up, and help us move. And whether or not body building is your hobby, muscles need your constant attention because the way you treat them on a daily basis determines whether they will wither or grow. Say you’re standing in front of a door, ready to pull it open. Your brain and muscles are perfectly poised to help you achieve this goal. First, your brain sends a signal to motor neurons inside your arm. When they receive this message, they fire, causing muscles to contract and relax, which pull on the bones in your arm and generate the needed movement. The bigger the challenge becomes, the bigger the brain’s signal grows, and the more motor units it rallies to help you achieve your task. But what if the door is made of solid iron? At this point, your arm muscles alone won’t be able to generate enough tension to pull it open, so your brain appeals to other muscles for help. You plant your feet, tighten your belly, and tense your back, generating enough force to yank it open. Your nervous system has just leveraged the resources you already have, other muscles, to meet the demand. While all this is happening, your muscle fibers undergo another kind of cellular change. As you expose them to stress, they experience microscopic damage, which, in this context, is a good thing. In response, the injured cells release inflammatory molecules called cytokines that activate the immune system to repair the injury. This is when the muscle-building magic happens. The greater the damage to the muscle tissue, the more your body will need to repair itself. The resulting cycle of damage and repair eventually makes muscles bigger and stronger as they adapt to progressively greater demands. Since our bodies have already adapted to most everyday activities, those generally don’t produce enough stress to stimulate new muscle growth. So, to build new muscle, a process called hypertrophy, our cells need to be exposed to higher workloads than they are used to. In fact, if you don’t continuously expose your muscles to some resistance, they will shrink, a process known as muscular atrophy. In contrast, exposing the muscle to a high-degree of tension, especially while the muscle is lengthening, also called an eccentric contraction, generates effective conditions for new growth. However, muscles rely on more than just activity to grow. Without proper nutrition, hormones, and rest, your body would never be able to repair damaged muscle fibers. Protein in our diet preserves muscle mass by providing the building blocks for new tissue in the form of amino acids. Adequate protein intake, along with naturally occurring hormones, like insulin-like growth factor and testosterone, help shift the body into a state where tissue is repaired and grown. This vital repair process mainly occurs when we’re resting, especially at night while sleeping. Gender and age affect this repair mechanism, which is why young men with more testosterone have a leg up in the muscle building game. Genetic factors also play a role in one’s ability to grow muscle. Some people have more robust immune reactions to muscle damage, and are better able to repair and replace damaged muscle fibers, increasing their muscle-building potential. The body responds to the demands you place on it. If you tear your muscles up, eat right, rest and repeat, you’ll create the conditions to make your muscles as big and strong as possible. It is with muscles as it is with life: Meaningful growth requires challenge and stress."

One is that you should stop focusing on whether or not your indefblock was justified. What happened to you (blocks escalated after you didn't keep your cool while being blocked, but instead throwing red flags like new accounts in the face of all admins) isn't a case of you being singled out by an abusive admin, but actually fairly typical admin behaviour. At some point we tend to lose our patience and decide that a user is more trouble than they are worth (and the community expects us to make such decisions). You have a collection of accounts, all with block logs attached, that make it a bit wearying to even try to find out whether you were treated fairly at all times in the past. I think that you should stick to one account, strictly limit yourself to one revert, and you should not expect to find justice on Wikipedia for everything wrong that has happened to you. If others make a decision about you that you think is unfair and wrong, please first try to understand where they are coming from before you title your unblock request """"to right a great wrong"""".

 :: The Albanian word for Vampire is Dhampir (Dham = teeth and Pir = drink/suck) … In the Albanian language the verb pir/pin/pi means simultaneously to drink and to suck … (e.g. the albanians say: """"mushkonja/shushunja me ka pir gjakun"""" = """"the mosquito/leech sucked my blood""""). Thus the name Dhampir means Teeth-sucker … sucking via teeth. Dhampir is the original name of the later corrupted and slavicized """"vampir"""". Dhampirs are evil nightly creatures with sharp and long teeth, very strong, quick, heavy and are mostly invisible to the eyes of the normal People. They fear the fire, the running water and the daylight, but like the music. These are dead people which were angry. They get up from the grave and come at night, bite people and animals and drinks their blood. Dhampirs are very sadistic; they terrify, beat up, rape women, kill and eat people. 

  
 ::Only a Dhampirash (Dhampirash = the child of a vampire father and a human mother) is capable to see the Dhampires, and knows how to fight or kill them. 

 ::He must make a circle from some burnable material and blood on the ground; afterward he lures the vampire into the circle while positioning himself in the middle of the circle, playing the fife (recorder) or whistling. Then he puts fire on the circle, so that the terrified Dhampire from the fire cannot flee, forcing the Dhampire to fight him. 

 ::Dhampirash must kill and burn the Dhampir, or new Dhampires will rise from every glow of these fires of a circle. When he has him killed and completely burnt, he must take his ashes/cinders and throw them in a river. (I told shortly and only the most important one) 

  
 ::Old tales from the Albanian folklore (Kosovo). 

  
 ::Slavs, Romanians and Roma (Gypsies) cannot pronounce the Albanian letter DH (DH = TH English like in The,Then,They,This,That etc.) so they usually replace it by the more convenient letter V. And some of Slavic people replace it by letter L (e.g. the Bosnians). 

 ::When a Slav (serv), Romanian or Roma (Gypsie) spells the Albanian word Dham for Teeth, he pronounces it as Vam (?), because he is incapable to say Dham (teeth). The Bosnians spells it as Lam (Dham). 

 ::When the Slavs came to Europe, they came into contact with the Albanian (Pelasgo-Illyrian) tales. Later they changed, corrupted and slavicized the name Dhampir into """"Vampir"""" and """"Lampir"""" (similar to other Albanian words), because they could not pronounce the original name Dhampir. Now, they try to claim these words for themselves, as well as others that were similarly amended from the Albanian vacabulary, but the original meaning of these words is lost, because they carry no connotation in Slavic or any other language, except for Albanian. 

 ::(Wikipedia: Serbian вампир/vampir, or, according to some sources, from Hungarian Vámpír. The Serbian and Hungarian forms have parallels in virtually all Slavic languages. The Bosnian Lampir which was the name of the oldest recorded vampire Meho Lampir.: Bulgarian вампир (Vampir)...) 

  
 ::If Romanians/Vlachs and bulgarians speak Albanian, they say: """"eve"""" (means edhe = also), """"Via """" (means Dhia = goat), """"Uve"""" (Udhe = path), """"Voma"""" (Dhoma = room), """"Vam"""" (Dham = tooth) and """"Vampir"""" (Dhampir = Vampire) 

  
 ::And if the Bosnians speak Albanian, they say: """"ele"""" (means edhe = also), """"Lia """" (means Dhia = goat), """"Ule"""" (Udhe = path), """"Loma"""" (dhoma = room), """"Lam"""" (Dham = tooth) and """"Lampir"""" (Dhampir = Vampire). 

  
 ::The Albanian word for the female vampires is Dhampiresha/Dhampireshe ... (e.g., Luan (m) Luanesha/e (f) = lion (m) lioness (f) etc. 

  
 ::There are also Albanian surname """"Dhampiri"""", and this surname means """"Vampire"""".

Well, my point is that Navarre (for example) has indoubtly links to the Basque Country (some parts do speak basque, some historical links...) and even have another association much related to the IRL called EUSKARA KULTUR ELKARGOA. But that doesn't mean we should link both regions in the same basket. The navarrese government has never expressed any intention of reducing its own political or social identity, the same way Andorra, Balears or Valencia haven't either. Participating in a single cultural project such as the IRL, doesn't mean that suddenly those territories have renounced to their own identities (so close or so distanct to the Catalan proper). We are not even explaining that it is just a part of the population which may be considered as catalans... We are not talking about the spanish-speakers (around 50% of all the inhabitants of these regions), the french-speakers or simply all the foreigners living for years in these territories:

Balearic Islands: 21% of the total pop. (that's 224K)
Catalonia: 15% of the total pop. (that's 1,1 million)
Valencia: 17,7% of the total pop. (that's 866K)

They sum up as 2,2 million people who don't consider themselves neither Catalan nor Valencian nor Balearic. Then, add the national population which don't speak a word of the language (2,6 million link) or even the ones who can speak it but don't use it as primary language (it roses up to around 50% of the total pop.)...

So, because of that, I keep thinking that putting ALL the inhabitants of these territories (or just the name of the regions) in the same basket is so so so """"dangerous""""... We are talking about figures ranging between 30% and 50% of people who may have a much doubtly catalanity... And that's a LOT of people. MauritiusXXVII (Aut Disce, Aut Doce, Aut Discede!). """

Here he attempts yet again, to blow smoke all our arses.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:You are the one who is disrupting Wikipedia. I am upholding the consensus.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``TharkunColl believes that the English and Welsh are not ethnic twins of Southern Britain (in the present day and age), perhaps unaware that they are indistinguishable to the world at large. The Principality of Wales has not been its own country since before Edward I of England, while the Principality of Liechtenstein is an independent country that has no real ethnic status different from its neighbours. His argument is to play up national-separatist sentiments that serve nobody in the present day, about a Principality vis a vis Kingdomwhich form bestows actual ethnic statuses to peoples. Wales has never been featured on the arms of state and seals of office that denote independence, the chief marker of separate identity among the nations in Europe. That the Welsh people page exists, doesn't qualify its existence. This guy believes that there is a sort of ``Anglo-Celtic subrace`` of Europeans, that is defined only by the British Isles (an idea only popular among xenophobic yobbos proud of the British Empire's world domination, in an era circa the Great War). He believes that Brittany is part of the British Isles, rather than a former duchy in the Kingdom of Franceby choice over allegiance to England in the Breton War of Succession. He believes that mass settlement, colonisation and the transcendence of national cultures is arguable in favour of the people under Canute the Great's dominion as governed by Winchester, but denies any significance in relations from 1066 (until the present) as determined by London and what the Normans did which transformed the populace in all waysespecially ancestry and tongue, to form actual and extant connections with the French, Scots and Irishthe countries England has dealt with for the past millenium. He uses racial definitions in respect to the ``Celtic fringe`` and their English relationship, for we all know how the English never held special favour to them until the Hanoverians changed the political climate and drew sympathy from the English for the harsh oppressions of that regime which never bred into the population of the British Isles and was ``naturally nativised``. The user believes the Norman Conquest was as removed from the people as the Constitutional Hanoverian rule, but more bloody and causing a Marxist class struggle between monarch and subject for centuries as opposed to a few decades in which it was possible to secure their integration as part of the English people themselves. My other opponent User:Enzedbrit believes that the Norman Channel Islanders are no different from the English, but TharkunColl thinks they are foreigners (since 1066) compared to the Celtic fringe (whom only assimilated to the English way of life because of aftereffects created by the Norman Conquest of England). This person has attacked my nationality as Canadian and put my knowledge into question, simply because I'm not jingoistic to punish the French in any and every discussion of themwe in Canada have learnt to get along, because English and French are more alike than differentdespite intense rivalry. He tries to speak with authority and down to me, while it is obvious that he is a crank out of the mainstream of academic institutions but well within the realm of football hooliganism.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Read what I wrote. I believe that the Welsh and English are indeed very close, but quite obviously still retain separate ethnic identities. You are trying to say that they are English. For your own sake, please don't say that if you ever go to Wales. I have never made any claims about an ``Anglo-Celtic subrace`` and nor do I believe Britanny is part of the British Isles. Why do you ascribe false beliefs to me? As for you being a Canadian, all it means is that you may have a completely false view of what the English are like, based on your misperception of history. As I said, just because Canada is an Anglo-French society, it doesn't mean that England is. And the only crank here is you I'm afraid.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``I made a reference to the Tudors being England's chief representative of the Romano-British in England's culture and identity, which you think is ludicrous or have problems interpreting what was written. It was the Tudors who brought a revival of King Arthur, which made it an official mythology of England.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The Tudors lived about a thousand years after the Romano-British period, so to call them a representation of it sounds a tad unreasonable. And their revival of the Arthurian myths was purely political.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``You have only tried to deny any and every relationship the English and French have ever had, plus what is to come. You have deliberately skewed facts to serve your Ethnocentric Socialist agenda, to continue berating Anglo-French traditions which have survived into the present. You deny the (sorry, epipalaeolithic rather than neolithic) Azilio-Tardenoisian microlithic culture of Southern Britain and Gaul, which was the basis of relations which supported such a state as the Gallic Empire, making it further affluential during the time of Offa of Mercia's Angles and Charlemagne's Franks in their unity among the Teutons of Europe and across the English Channeljust as the Bretons and Welsh maintained ties along the same body of water. The fact that the capitals of England and France have always been Channel-focused, especially since the Norman Conquest, Angevin Empire and Hundred Years' War, eludes him in such concepts as Western Europe and the Entente Cordiale, or the rate of assimilation between the English and French in their colonial empires. He thinks it is alright to look backwards to an England unchanged by 1066, but then changed by 1689 and the changes effected since the Glorious Revolution as the only native English identity (ignoring 600 years). He calls me an aristocrat, but I accept all English relations and you'll find nil elitist separatism based upon identity politics and special interests in my heartunlike him and his nationalist agenda to purify the English identity from a Marxist standpoint, which was what the Nazis did in WWII GermanyTharkunColl's enemies are the Franks, to Adolf Hitler's Jews. His Final Solution is to revise history and purge all connections between the English and French, the English being Aryan and French being Semitic. It doesn't phase him that the Franks were among the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Roman Britain, that all traditional books make a reference of this and it is supported by archaeology in that time period. It would appall TharkunColl to accept the Greco-Roman contributions to the English identity and culture, but we all inherit something some of us consider Black sheep (term) in our families.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I have never said that cultural exchanges did not cross the Channel, because they clearly did. But cultural exchanges do not erase ethnic differences. Your talk of prehistoric cultures is irrelevant in an article about the English. Furthermore, London is far more North Sea focused than Channel focused (look on a map). I won't even bother refuting your accusations of my being a Nazi, or a Socialist, or whatever - those who resort to personal abuse have invariably lost the argument. And, incidentally, I did not call you an aristocrat. You are just a fantasist.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``TharkunColl believes that there is no organic, symbiotic relationship between royalty and subjects in all parts of the world, but this only changed since constitutional monarchy was created in the British Isles. Everybody can claim royal heritage, depending on how long ago they get it and it is widely known that the monarchy has historically been iconic for English identity. Recent British Republicanism should not be confused with precedent and connection, which is largely based on a recent influx of Bolkshevik (or what, Jacobin a la French Revolutionaries? How surprising!) ideology as a result of the Cold War. To be English is to be anti-Communist, as exemplified in the James Bond films. This guy thinks he is a ``True Englishman``, but he gets it wrong almost every time. Subjects are forbidden from using the royal arms without permission, but it is a symbol of ethnic identity traditionally found throughout Europe. He has Bolshevik fantasies, as evidenced on his various edits to Wikipedia articles in which he shows disdain for the survival of our common monarchy. He tries to remove French as the Englishman's lingua franca, but how often do Englishmen or Anglo-Americans not visit France and mingle with the people for their chief/number one international experience? He asserts that my descent from John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster is just a Mediaeval fantasy because the ancestor is Anglo-Norman and preposterous that the majority of Englishmen who have royal descent is from that man just happens to be irrelevant to the Plantagenets breeding with their subjects. You think that ignoring the Scottish and Irish about their objections to a close identification with the English are irrelevant, yet they are based on a series of English conquests of their lands and replacement of their identity. You hypocritically think that is a moot/negligable point, but not in the French case towards Englandwhich was more organic in every sense. How have the Celtic languages affected English?``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:What on earth is an ``organic, symbiotic relationship``? You are exposing your royalist fantasies yet again. In fact, a monarchy is a system of government, and like any other it has its advantages and disadvantages. When the people tire of it, they replace it with so"

To new and even more interesting projects, of course!  As announced in the newsletter, I've been preparing to co-coordinate a large collaboration/competition called Around the World.  It was going to be run at the Awards Center, but since that no longer exists, the collaboration will be hosted somewhere else.  Around the World will begin July 15th as planned - it's location will be announced soon.    It'll be a blast.  In the competition, participants will be helping to develop over 200 pages (drafts, which will be moved to article space once they are ready), using advanced tools to edit every single one of them!  This is going to be interesting.  And the event shall have awards which are being created specifically for it as we speak!  If you would like me to keep you informed of this and other interesting collaborations I'll be working on and/or organizing in the future, please drop me a note on my talk page, and I'll be happy to keep you in the know.

He or she (not sure who she/he started as) is a radical militant left wing extremist who constantly pushes that extreme agenda on wiki. She has many cohorts and they are easy to spot by their edits on similar subjects of similar natures. The neutrality of Wikipedia is only a far fetched dream as it consistently leans far left. Editors on the government dime who spend their lives constantly on wiki promoting their radical agendas have hijacked any notion of neutrality. She does all kinds gaming the system and even outright violations but because they are leftist nothing serious is done to Roscelese or others in that camp. Wiki is done as a neutral agenda encyclopedia. The word is being spread like wildfire. In a few years wikis relevance will be negligible because of editors like Roscelese.

0,"Liver Disorders The liver is the second largest organ in your body and is located under your rib cage on the right side. It weighs about three pounds and is shaped like a football that is flat on one side. The liver performs many jobs in your body. It processes what you eat and drink into energy and nutrients your body can use. The liver also removes harmful substances from your blood. How does a healthy diet help the liver? Eating a healthy diet helps the liver to do its functions well and to do them for a long time.  Eating an unhealthy diet can lead to liver disease. For example, a person who eats a lot of fatty foods is at higher risk of being overweight and having non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. For people who have liver disease, eating a healthy diet makes it easier for the liver to do its jobs and can help repair some liver damage. An unhealthy diet can make the liver work very hard and can cause more damage to it. What does a healthy diet include? •Eating foods from all the food groups: grains, proteins, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and fats •Eating foods that have a lot of fiber such as fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grain breads, rice and cereals Are there diet changes for those with liver disease? It is important for people with liver disease to maintain a healthy weight by eating a balanced diet with foods from all food groups. Also, •Do not eat uncooked shellfish such as oysters and clams •Limit eating foods that have a lot of sugar or salt Liver Diseases and Diet Some liver diseases have specific diet recommendations: Bile Duct Disease Bile is a liquid made in the liver that helps break down fats in the small intestine. Bile duct disease keeps bile from flowing to the small intestine. Diet Recommendations: • Use fat substitutes • Use kernel oil (i.e. canola, olive, corn, sunflower, peanut, flax seed oils) because it needs less bile to break down fats than other types of oil Cirrhosis Cirrhosis is the scarring and hardening of the liver. Diet Recommendations: •Limit salt and foods that contain a lot of salt •Talk to your doctor about how much protein to have in your diet Fatty Liver Disease Fatty liver disease is the build up of fat in liver cells. Diet Recommendations: •Limit foods that are high in calories •Eat foods that have fiber Hemochromatosis Hemochromatosis is the build up of iron in the liver. Diet Recommendations: •Do not eat foods that have iron •Do not use iron pots and pans •Do not take pills with iron •Do not eat uncooked shellfish Hepatitis C Hepatitis C is a disease of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus. Diet Recommendations: •Limit foods that have a lot of iron •Do not use iron pots and pans •Limit salt and foods that contain a lot of salt Wilson Disease Wilson disease is the build up of copper in the body. Diet Recommendations: •Limit foods that have copper such as chocolate, nuts, shellfish and mushrooms • Do not use copper pots •Limit eating fatty foodskawaljeet bhinder  Nutritionist "

 My Two Cents 

 Political correctness will be the end of our world as we know it. This is sad that political correctness has come to this level. It is causing our society to reward failure and condone criminal behavior. This is sad. We might as well change the constitution and exclude freedom of speech. This is next. Truly sad. Truly sad, indeed. 

 Also, regardless what you want to refer to the chinese as, china is the reason why the US's economy is in the crapper, and why our unemployment rate is higher than it has been since the early 1980's. We have made """"those people"""" rich while our economic infrastructure is crumbling. Open your eyes!

And for those reasons, I despise China as well as the politically correct.

 Niggardly 
It is apparent by reading wiki's page on the """"controversial"""" word """"niggardly"""", that stupid people and words do not mix. It has been said that most people never pick up a book after leaving high school. Proof of this exists in the fact that this word can be taken so blatantly out of definition, that persons are asking that it be banned from the English language. As I said, idiots and words can be a dangerous combination.

What is even sadder is that I expressed this comment on wiki's niggardly page, and was accused of vandalism, yet others posted similar comments. I must of hit a nerve with some """"idiots"""" who don't have a large understanding of the English language and it proper usage. LOL!"""

There, he wrote: ``…there is in the state of nature nothing which by universal consent is pronounced good or bad; for in the state of nature everyone thinks solely of his own advantage, and according to his disposition, with reference only to his individual advantage, decides what is good or bad, being bound by no law to anyone besides himself.``  Lestrade`"

And Matisyahu seems to acknowledge this when he says: ``All of my songs are influenced and inspired by the teachings that inspire me. I want my music to have meaning, to be able to touch people and make them think. Chasidism teaches that music is 'the quill of the soul.' Music taps into a very deep place and speaks to us in a way that regular words can't.`` So, I think he would be more than pleased to answer what are his views on homosexuality and whether his songs can be interpreted by gay teenagers to mean that they should fight for their freedom to express their sexuality, especially when he says: ``Young man control in your hand / Slam your fist on the table / And make your demand / Take a stand / Fan a fire for the flame of the youth / Got the freedom to choose`` and things like that.  `"

 It wasn't confusion, I was trying to be polite.

 Please reconsider taking a break 

It's not just because of Sapphic's loss of temper that I'm suggesting a break, although it certainly plays a part.  I really think more progress would be made (in arriving at a community decision supported — and enforced — by ArbCom, as well as in getting the injunction lifted) if the named parties all removed themselves from the situation.

As for my comments about your son, I did NOT mean to imply that his trying out to be a SEAL was important to you and nobody else.  If I'd meant that, I'd have written it that way.  I don't like sarcasm or veiled insults, and prefer the more direct variety.  If I'm not writing mean things to you, then you can be sure I'm not thinking mean thoughts about you when I write whatever I do write.  I think in at least that one aspect of things, we have pretty similar views, and I definitely respect you for being able to shrug off insults.

I'm not posting anything to any of the dates-related pages for at least a week, I'm fairly sure I'll be able to convince Sapphic to do the same, and hopefully Locke Cole will follow suit.  You can choose to keep posting, but I don't think you're actually helping your cause by doing so at this point, and you may in fact be hurting it.  Most of the reason I picked the names I did is because we all seem to have a rather...

 Hello A Gooner, and nice to meet you. """"Radical"""" can be defined as """"favoring or effecting fundamental or revolutionary changes in current practices, conditions, or institutions."""" In this instance it is not being used pejoratively or as a critique, but rather an accompanying term to signify that his ideology at this time had become crystallized and in its post-Arbenz state, was indeed """"radical"""". Che himself never shunned away from acknowledging the """"radical"""" nature of the transformational Marxist world revolution which he believed was necessary, and in fact saw the term if anything as a compliment.

The reference """"Hamilton 1853"""" is insufficient. We should refer to a specific section in that treatise.

Only then will be able to definitely resolve the question whether Hamilton was dealing with matrices of quaternions or just with quaternions.

We cannot say who is right, although we are required to analyze the level of importance of each argument, and include the opinions in due weight to their representation in the real world. This is fundamentally what Wikipedia doescollect information from other sources, summarize it, and report it in encyclopedic format.  We do not make judgments about who is right or wrong.

Not sure where to put this, so I'll put it here. Tomorrow I'll take a peek at places like the Village Pump, the Help Desk, or perhaps the editorial council page thingy that I saw somewhere and see if I should post my query there.

I've noticed that a subject I've done some contributing to is lacking its own article. Cable television red-links to digital telephone service. General Communications, Inc. red-links to digital cable telephony (I created that one).

If I were king of the world, I would create an article called digital telephony and make both of the above-mentioned red-links redirects to it. Or perhaps I would create a disambiguation page that links to digital cable telephony, digital fiber-optic telephony, VoIP and other similar articles (some of which don't exist yet.

Alas, I might be king of the world — or at least have editing power in the Wikipedia — but I don't have the time or knowledge to create an entire article about it. What should be done? Should I (or someone else) create a stub and redirect both?

I'm just afraid that someone will create an article under one entry but it won't be tied together with another entry, and there will forever be a dichotomy...or at worst parallel universes in which information is not shared between related subjects.

Are my fears unfounded? Should I just leave it be and let it evolve on its own?

But, in general, there is also some ambiguity between tensors and pseudotensors (or between even and odd) when it comes to integrands.  An example in one dimension, when  and  is:

The first integral is equal to either of the other two integrals.  In the second integral the integrand transforms like a tensor (or odd tensor) density, but the integration limits are no longer from lower to higher; in a higher-dimensional example they would be no longer right-handed.  In the second integral the integrand transforms like a pseudotensor (or even tensor) density because we have kept the integration limits in proper order, −b < −a; in higher dimensions we would say that we are maintaining right-handedness.

0,"`  ::  kinda.  I'll partially reverse that, for three reasons.  The main one stems from the argument I'm having on Wrestlemania XXVIII vis-a-vis the Daniel Bryan cash-in and the concept that appears to be getting rammed down my throat of WP:Crystal, even though I have demonstrated that not to be the case over there.  If putting Bryan, by the nature of the program and at this point and time, on the Mania XXVIII card is WP:Crystal, then the concept of the strippage and any Raw title match in Hampton, VA tomorrow night (7/25) is also, technically, WP:Crystal as well.  ::This redoubles when you look at the second reason.  We now know that SOMETHING is going on between Punk and WWE, and that this grand angle is going a fairly new and viral direction.  Still, end of the day, we can't source that he's under contract, but they are keeping it well under wraps.  ::The third reason is a timeline continuity-break in the storyline.  The best I can say (and what I posted today) is that the current title status is unknown.  Consider the following from the storyline:  The Board meeting which ended McMahon's tenure took place several hours before McMahon announced the tournament.  So, is the tournament valid?  Is the final valid?  Now, consider the timeline of the ``questionable decisions`` involved.  Is the lifting of the suspension valid if the ``fire Cena`` stipulation is not?  Is Cena the champ?  Is Punk the champ?  Is Alberto del Rio also #1 Contender on top of Senor Dinero el en Banco?  Is the Rey/Miz tournament final valid?  We have a storyline continuity break which probably will be addressed on the 7/25 RAW.  But, as of the moment, the entire current status is unknown.  Punk may well be entitled to this entire week as champion, or not even be entitled to a reign at all (though we do have official sourcing, as of the moment, to clear that entitlement for the moment)!  Anything else gets to WP:Crystal material as far as some are concerned here.    `"

 :How the dispute developed was the article originally had the form Martin seems to prefer (see for example the version when it was first promoted as an FA).  In this version, the one and only solution presented in the """"solution"""" section was essentially vos Savant's solution.  In February 2008 an anonymous editor opened Pandora's box.  This user took issue with not featuring a solution based on conditional probability but instead featuring a solution that one of the basic sources (the much maligned on these pages Morgan et al.) calls """"a false solution"""".  In the initial discussion with this user  (discussion continues into archive 7) I played the part currently being played by Martin (!), i.e. resisting the addition of a conditional solution early in the article on the grounds that the """"simple"""" solution is perfectly fine.  After MUCH discussion on these pages, a compromise was reached where both """"simple"""" and conditional solutions were presented - and this compromise form was vetted by the entire community during the FA review initiated in March 2008 .

I don't think it is right to take the world consensus as the right stance to take in this issue. Terms like 'coup d'etat' have great weight in international politics, and using it implies unconstitutionality, illegality, and wide disapproval within the country itself. Left-wing governments like Venezuela will obviously disagree with the takeover. It is unsurprising that the USA also disagrees with it, Obama probably trying to not look like he is a leader that supports military removals of leaders in South America. The EU and other international bodies like the UN disagree with it because any stance otherwise will look like they do not support supreme state sovereignty. Although I can not support these claims with evidence, the fact is that bias in their responses may possible exist, and therefore using international response as the basis for naming something like this which is a POV is inherently creating bias in the article itself.

3. I convinced videolover that the 1984 FBI warnings are orange, meaning that the 1984 FBI warnings are orange and the 1986 FBI warnings are red, which I also convinced him of.

4. I have seen the 1997 VHS of """"The Jungle Book"""" before, there is no BV logo on there. Your seeing things. BTW, it is true that there are some copies that don't feature the green format logo on there, but it it also true that some copies actually had the green format logo. I have seen both those copies before, which both do not feature the BV logo.

5. A couple of my friends have """"Cool Runnings"""", they have the previews I mentioned on there, it is real and a later printing, I thought that needed to be added on there.

6. I didn't know that """"The Sword in the Stone"""" was sold in a black clamshell case, I thought it was sold in white because every case is in white. I could be wrong, but I say the version in black clamshell is the March 1986 edition, the one in white clamshell is from May 1986, the version that doesn't feature the trailer is from June 1986, the version where the FBI warnings slideshow came out October 1986, the version with a different tape label is from January 1987, and finally, the version where the cover doesn't have the VHS words means it came out February 1988.

7. I think the version where it has previews came out May 1986, the version with no previews and FBI warnings fading came out October 1986 because it was still in progression of editing, the version where the FBI warnings slideshow came out December 1986 because DSAS: vol.2 came out that day, meaning that version with the red FBI warnings and the VDA came out January 1987.

Here's why I've deleted/replaced a couple of your phrases/sentences:  ``...figurative language uses more poetic senses.``  Although it's used a lot in poetry, figurative language is used in a lot more contexts than just poetry. When I shake my fist at someone on the freeway and call them an ``a__hole,`` I'm using figurative language (the figure of speech is synecdoche) without being poetic in any sense of the word.  ``In literal language, truth conditions work out well, while in figurative language, they may not.``   IMO the definition of terms in this sentence will be unclear to most general readers of an encyclopedia. What are ``truth conditions``? If it's a technical term, we'd better define it.  Also, I moved the following to this page  - == To add ==  * Why would someone want to divide language into literal and figurative? What is gained thereby? (Lakoff provides some insight here.) * Why would people prefer not to view language with this divide? * How does this connect to theories of truth?``  -  These are all needed additions. The last one, especially, shows the importance and relevance of this subject to a broad range of disciplines, including theories of knowledge, cognition, language development, etc., etc.  And now....here's an explanations for one of my suspect assertions -)  ``Some have boiled down the more than two hundred and fifty figures described in classical and traditional linguistics into two: metaphor and metonymy.``  I know this from research, and my additions to Further Reading document reflect the ``classical and traditional`` end of this statement.

0,"In Response

Dear “Lessheard vanU” and to Wikipedia including all editors and administrators & Mr. Wales:   This is a very serious issue.  We contributing writers have attempted to follow wikipedia written polices in contributing and adding to an existing article or creating one.  Yet there are double standards beings upheld by wikipedia’s own editors and administrators.  As with Blackpearl14, who clearly believes that wikipedias polices don’t apply to her, and with other editors who uphold double standards.   Then when challenged to the double standards, including Blackpearl14's violation of wikipedia’s own written polices and reckless authoritarian rule and control, other wikipedia editors and administrators then support each other when one of them continues to violate wikipedia’s own written polices.    “Lessheard vanU” had then wrongly and deliberately calls the contributing people who writes back and flags the issue at hand a “harassing the editor”, outright agreeing with Blackpearl14.  Then in addition to IP address being blocked, all “talk & discussion” are deleted  leaving only one sided bias and reckless claims against the contributing writers.  Even though wrongly deleted by wikipedia editors & administrators, all of this has been recorded, including that Blackpearl14 having repeatedly writing in both correspondence and her bio page (copies have been secure)  that the articles belong to her and they will continue to be own and controlled by her.  These statements alone proves that she is in violation of wikipedia’s own written polices and purpose.  Yet you have ignored that.

As previously written in discussion, per wikipedia’s own written polices, but immediately deleted by Blackpearl14 and then sanctioned by  “Lessheard vanU”, Blackpearll4 - calls herself evidently Mrs. Johnny Depp and Pirate lord-ess and such.  She celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean for wikipedia.   Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages, and then recklessly calls anyone who doesn’t follow her bias views vandals, attackers and such.   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral and is against wikipedia’s own written polices.  Sorry, but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.   As recorded, Blackpearl14's pages regarding this issue are one sided, not neutral, are bias, in conflict of interest and are all promotional tools promoting the causes and products of the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean.   Yes, Pirates of the Caribbean and similar wikipedia articles are not neutral, they are a series of one sided promotional pages including links to products and causes of the Walt Disney Company.   Following wikipedia’s own written “neutral” policy, entire articles would have to be deleted.    Yet Blackpearl14 continues to violate Wikipedia polices and purpose.  

Then with IP’s being deliberately blocked and contributing writers having been wrongly accused and falsely called various things, if anyone then attempts to generate a new article related to Pirates of the Caribbean following wikipedia’s own written polices, editors and administrators gang up and generate false reason upon reason, to delete those articles and ban the IP user.   They use a countless list of double standards and twisted logic to justify their reckless acts.   It’s a total lock out by the editors and administrators, abusing their trust tools, acting like a private monarchy.   To date, Blackpearl14's has proven she has ultimate control, has repeatedly stated that is her purpose, and had even sought to have the articles locked.    Then you “Lessheard vanU” wrote that you don’t want to lock these articles, stating it goes against company policy, but yet you added that you are preparing to possibly lock the articles in some capacity and do other acts against those who have been falsely branded and wrongly labeled as “vandals” and “harassing the editors” etc...

Other editors and administrators who have proven their practice of bias and manipulative and outright double standards practices include “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and “Chris Mann”.   We have documented that they say one thing, yet practice another.   We have documented that they enforce one set of wikipedia polices yet discard and ignore those same policies when it applies to themselves or their selective circle of peers.   We contributing writers also wonder just how many editors and admin"

1,"LMGTFY hasn't been amusing in,  oh,  I don't know, a decade.  I'm glad you found out about a very old website,  but no one is going to click either of those.  Also this is completely irrelevant here.   Edit:  For those who are downvoting me because you think this guy is fine with how he did this, LMFTFY,   So you don't, unless you for some reason enjoy sitting and wasting time,  don't waste  your damn time with his links...   http://google.com/search?q=biden+pedophile+site%3Areddit.com  Compare to Bing:  http://bing.com/search?q=biden+pedophile+site%3Areddit.com   Edit 2:  So that seemed odd to me,  really. I decided to play with it a bit more.  After testing, oddly,  I don't think this is a case of google modifying specific search results but a broad sweep which may have some other reason for being in place;   See here:   http://google.com/search?q=pedophile+site%3Areddit.com  This works and displays results.  For me the first result is Total POS admits to being a pedophile  Now if I search for pedophile POS it should work,  right?   http://google.com/search?q=POS+pedophile+site%3Areddit.com  So we know a known result is not coming back with proper search terms.   Edit 3:  it seems ANY COMBINATION of [word] + pedophile has no results.  Not sure why that happens but it is NOT specifically related to biden,  except that biden is a [word] + pedophile.    Using one of the most common words in english,  ""The"" we can see this results in the same no results:   http://google.com/search?q=the+pedophile+site%3Areddit.com  I think this at least dismisses the idea that google is directly modifying search results for a specific and focused purpose in this.  Frankly this is much more confusing than that would be,  I really do wonder why it is setup as such, It seems a bad method to avoid politically searches as such, when you can just do:   https://www.google.com/search?q=biden+kids+site%3Areddit.com  and the second result for me is ""joe biden is a pedophile"" with numerous more results trailing down.   I think this puts the idea they're using this specific case mentioned by the poster above for this purpose.  They may modify results or other nefarious and biased things,  but this particular case, it isn't happening.     Please when you make claims, look deeper.  Otherwise we become just like those media asshats we don't like,  the ones who jump to conclusions and scream RACIST, SEXIST, or POLITICAL FALSE NARRATIVE!  Let's not be them.  We're here to make sure they don't do that,  we can't do that if we are the ones also participating in knee-jerk assumptions and baseless claims resulting from an n=1 result.  While my initial post was simply me being annoyed at seeing a LMGTFY link in a post >2010, I felt the need to examine this a bit deeper when I made the initial links that did show something was up.  I hope this sets the record straight for this particular occurance.    In the end,  look,  feel free to downvote me,  I don't care much about the karmic value of my comments, I've plenty of imaginary internet points to go around.  It was not a far jump for me to assume he was a troll,  on a website with millions of users many of who do just that on a regular basis,  when it is just as simple if not less work to type google.com/search?q=X or bing.com/search?q=X than it is to google it for me.

 """"Further reading"""" 

Hallo Wikisjt3: I've seen some discussion on various talk pages about this. (,  - just to run this past your eyes too.)

The church already has an article, at St. Mary of the Visitation Catholic Church (Huntsville, Alabama), as it's on the NRHP. (It's unfortunate that the book title doesn't identify which """"St Mary of the Visitation"""" church it's about, but I traced it with a bit of detective work: Alabama was mentioned somewhere, there's a helpful disambiguation page at St. Mary's Church, there's only one listed in Alabama, and the church website confirms this book as being about this church.)

I've added this book as """"Further reading"""" (sourced from the Worldcat record), which I think seems appropriate even though the book does not see WP:NOTABLE enough to have its own article. Anyone wanting to learn more about the church now knows this book exists, and can link the isbn to trace the catalog record in Worldcat and perhaps elsewhere. 

It may be that there is some more information which could usefully be added to the article about the church, sourced to the book (as far as I  know the book would qualify as a """"Reliable source""""). The article at present is entirely about the architecture of the building, not the history of the church as an organisation. In adding anything, remember to write in your own words and not copy the text of the book, which would be a breach of copyright. And please remember not to overwhelm readers with too much detail: less can be more if it lets the most important aspects shine out. D """

 :::The distinction is somewhat arbitrary, depending on reservoir temperature more than anything - and it's hotter in Venezuela. However, if heavy oil occurs in the designated oil sands areas of Alberta, the government arbitrarily deems it to be bitumen and charges a lower royalty rate. Hence Canadian companies are quite happy to call it bitumen rather than heavy oil. The Venezuelan government would rather call it extra-heavy oil and charge more money for it. In either case, if the API gravity is around 10, which is to say the density is about the same as water, it doesn't sink but rather forms an oil/water emulsion which is rather difficult to separate and accounts for many of the production problems and costs.   19:12, 18"

I moved what was originally the first paragraph (dealing with the types within the Norman breed) to the history section. Now the Characteristics sections contains one paragraph dealing with the various types that developed in the Anglo-Norman (the first paragraph) and one paragraph dealing with what the breed looked like in the mid-20th century before it was merged into the Selle Francais (the second paragraph).    * Regarding the hidden text in the 20th century section on ``However, when Anglo-Norman breeders as a whole were asked to vote, they rejected the idea of amending the studbook.``, Tsaag says she doesn't know when the vote took place.

0,"`Certain none of the responsible people were interested to take credit for those insignificant bridges.  The term ``mukim`` was certain the Malay name for the area smaller than the district level. In Malaysia that term is still in used on the maps. For instance there is a place know as Senai in the State of Johore.On the Map it is listed as Mukim of Senai. The Roman numeric standard was an older form of numbering adopted for used by the the British from the Latin. For instance  I (one) to X (ten), V (five) and III(three). So when the figure of XVIII is exactly 18 by our new standard. Therefore the name Mukim XVIII of Ang Mo Kio signify the area located on the Map. Presently it not the site of the New Town of Ang Mo Kio but just next along side. It was the housing estate built by the United Overseas Land Limited known as ``Faber Gardens``. This was the kampong area where our old attap dwelling used to stand at No. 126 A Lorong Kukus.  In conclusion I suggest that the name of Mukim of Ang Mo kio is far older than the new Town of Ang Mo Kio. It is highly likely than the name was chosen by Town builders following that original name on the Map.    `"

You should know that after checking the references again I discerned that you are abolutely correct.  Indeed, it is not Blackshire Belay that Baugh posits as his source for Afrocentic view number (ii).  Based on the footnote number 8 that appears after the first phrase in numder (ii), i.e., “refer to the languages of the African diaspora as a whole;[8]” Baugh actually attributes this view to; Williams (1975) and Williams (1997).   This prompts the question; is the second phrase that appears to be a continuation of number (ii) which states; “or it may refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of English: either” also included as what Dr.Williams posits?  For if it is attributed to Dr. Williams, I still say it is not Afrocentric and to posit this phrase as an Afrocentric view is in fact an outright misrepresentation of what Dr. Williams has stated.

Whether or not the story of his visit to Galway (Columbus, not the crusty) is true, it is not far-fetched: prior to the plantation period Iberian links with the south and west coasts of Ireland were very strong; the west coast was used as a base by Spanish and Portuguese boats for their Newfoundland fisheries from the 15thC.; prior to it's destruction in the Desmond Wars in 1580, Dingle was described as a Spanish built town.

0," September 2013 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENlol. Regardless of intent or accident - I actually wish that GoingBatty would listen to my request and avoid pages that I'm working on. GoingBatty was (and still is) not interested in  Brazilian Hip Hop unless he's a secret gangster rapper. Maybe after a hard day in the hood with his scout charges this scoutmaster relaxes by expressing himself through rap. Anyway I'm bored by him and a whole bunch of other editors - all of whom seem to be here either as incognito moralists, conservatives, protectors of childhood, nationalists, etc. I imagine that many of the neo-nazi groups are here also. Its my experience of right-wingers that on the whole they don't want you to know what they are up too. I remember an arts center open mic night which I was attending being infiltrated by five or six or them. It was a surreal situation because none of them were actually musicians - they pretended to be comedians which allowed them the right to attend and perform. The woman who ran the night and who had no idea of how the BNP (British National Party) worked and put one of them in charge. I emailed the arts center due to the fact that I knew some of the people who ran the open mic nights (including the woman who had been put in overall charge and had made the decision to put him in charge) and got an email back saying the open mic nights were for everyone regardless of their political views. A week or two later I received another email saying that the arts center had decided to separate the comedy from the music by having separate nights for both. I'm  not too sure why but I do know that at one of the open mic nights the leader of this small BNP cell had been put in charge and after one of the singers had finished (she was colored) he said something that was really strange. I can't say what because people who were there may be reading this but it was racist. About a hundred people witnessed and heard what he said and everyone just sat silently in shock not knowing how to react - after all he was in charge. Now that is power. When you can persuade others that your intent is one thing and then position yourself to impose your will or views upon those who believe your original lie - well that is political power. Its not even a right wing thing since many left wing leaders have used to same ploy. It is the nature of a dogmatic personality who is seeking power to follow such a course when faced with opposition to their dogma. Here's what happened after the torrent scene released the membership list of the BNP and I spotted that one of them was a town planning consultant employed by my local council. I sent an email to my council of course. Evidently my council believe that hiring a BNP member as a town planning consultant for one of the most highly diverse ethnic towns in England was fine because his racist views shouldn't affect his ability to provide good advice. lol NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  21:51, 6"

It says in basic electricity, NAVPERS, that the total force, that will KILL YOU is not the voltage but the CURRENT. So the total EMF is the CURRENT. and Farday said that the decay in the battery is propotional to the VOLTAGE READING. So the total emf is the current, and the loss of power is from the voltage. and if you dont believe me, get a low voltage source, and put it so it has lots of current, and go kill yourself. Those were two jokes, that you did pick up. Laugh haha funny."

If there are any objections to this, please voice them here.  There is a very common misconception going around, that ad hominem is simply an attack against the person you're arguing with, but that is not necessarily the case.  Likewise, an 'attack' doesn't have to be name-calling or anything like that.  It could simply be something like ``you are wrong because you don't have a PhD in the subject.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere is a very important distinction that some, but not all parts of the article make between to types of attacks.NEWLINE_TOKENAd hominem attack:  ``Your argument is wrong because of [something about the person they are arguing with].``NEWLINE_TOKEN*``That piece of evidence may be true, but how could you possibly be right, you don't have any kind of degree or certification in this area.``NEWLINE_TOKEN*``There's no way he could be right about this area of quantum physics, the guy dances around naked in his house!``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNon-ad hominem attack: ``You're such a(n) [disparaging remark].

In the future I suggest that you take some courses in this before arguing about it.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSee the distinction?  If there's any confusion, I can clarify further.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease note that there is an exception of sorts, if the person you're arguing with IS the subject of the argument, then you can attack the characteristics of the person which are relevent to the argument.  Although I'm not sure if that's really an exception or just not considered ad hominem to begin with.  It depends if you define ad hominem as ``attacking the person as a basis for your argument`` OR ``attacking the persno as a basis for your argument in place of attacking their argument.``  The latter definition has the exception built-in, since you'd be attacking the person in addition to (not in place of) their argument.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN 6 July 2005 17:08 (UTC)`"

 re: blocking of IP 199.43.172.254 

Good morning.  You have been involved in the periodic blocking of this IP.  See block log.  If I'm counting correctly, this IP has been blocked 26 times before (after eliminating the temporary unblocks and reblocks).  I gather from your temporary unblocks that you sometimes edit from this IP.  Given the pattern of vandalism and the recurrence despite repeated warnings, I have put an extended block on this IP.  I believe that I have put the block on using the new """"anon-only"""" feature so hopefully it will have no impact on you or other signed in users.  And of course, all the anons can still read the encyclopedia in order to do their needed research.  Please let me know if there are any unintended consequences of this block.  Thanks.   (talk) """

 That’s right, Iran. It was our drone. And it was spreading homosexual Western ideas over Iran. We call it the bone-drone. Get used to it, you fabulous bearded Mullahs! 
 Let me just say that the wording used for the recent """"Iran incident"""" was misleading at best. Most people do not know that International airspace starts 12 nautical miles off the coast... so saying that the incident SUPPOSEDLY (we should definitely keep the supposedly, unless you believe what professional liars and spin doctors feed you like it's the word of Dog - which wouldn't surprise me considering the MASSIVE INFLUX OF RIGHT WING SCUM, SHILLS AND PROVOCATEURS WHO'VE INVADED WIKIPEDIA IN THE PAST 5 YEARS AND TURNED IT INTO A CESSPOOL) happened 16 miles from Iran does not make sense. It makes more sense to tell the god damned mother fucking truth and say that it SUPPOSEDLY occurred FOUR (4) miles from Iranian air space....while we (the USA) were SUPPOSEDLY using an expensive to operate piece of military equipment to do surveillance and recon over OPEN OCEAN WATERS... because the navy is into bird watching and flora fauna type shit... especially so close where Iran has extensive military and industrial facilities... because our leaders HAVEN'T totally admitted that we violate Iran's airspace all the time and will continue to do so despite the loss of the drone they SUPPOSEDLY hacked or whatever happened to it.    

  
 Hello there Mr. """"Semi-Retired"""" ... The biased, rash, inflammatory, speculative, antagonistic and sensationalist (3) article which are cited actually do back up the modifications I made. The incident occurred SUPPOSEDLY 4 miles from Iran's air space, not 16.

Truth be told, there is alot of overlap and grey in DSM IV, and I can see this holds true for the two bluelinked terms above.

(scratches chin in wise manner) I have to think about this some more.

 Problem in gallery and request for this article to be moved 

A lot of people in the image gallery are represented as Tajiks while this is not true. Ferodwsi was born in Iran, therefore he could not have been Tajik. Secondly Rabia Balkhi was of Arab descent therefore she could not have been of Tajik descent either. Lastly, why is Muhammad of Ghori included in the gallery of Tajiks? He was not Taik, the ghorids themselves were believed to be Pashtuns and they were NOT native speakers of the Persian language rather patronizers of the culture. There seems to be a lot of vandalism and propaganda being posted by Tajiks here themselves, with no evidence being provided. I also request the Tajik article to be removed to the """"Persian People"""" article as a sub-category to erase confusion of Tajiks being a separate group.

This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable.   If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion. To do this, add  on the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or ``db`` tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.  For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.   `"

 """"US Federal Government's obstruction of research"""" is not a matter governed by MEDRS. Other sources will do. And yes, the government, through Federal anti-marijuana laws, has prevented research and made it very difficult. It has only allowed some research which was designed to present marijuana in a negative light and has covered up research which was favorable. It has even patented some pharmaceutical cannabis-based products designed for beneficial medical use, and then failed to use those patents, effectively blocking such patented use. This is part of US history and part of the history of the failed War on Drugs. That war is far more political than it is medical or scientific. It has misused science all along.

I have also asked  to contribute. Feel free to add anything that you may not have known previously:  Asgardian being a proven sockpuppet user, which turns suspicious whenever various anonymous ips have reverted to his edits:   Asgardian's block page for consistent edit-warring, before starting to simply do one revert a day or so to get away with it, regardless if this is in direct violation of consensus, like in the Dormammu case:    Newer conflicts:     noticing that Asgardian has continually written edit-summaries that have little, or nothing to do with what he's actually doing, or even flat-out contradict it, and Asgardian stating that he'll continue to do so as long as he can get away with it:  ``I've grown very, very tired of edits like this where the editor does multiple things and then puts in a partially truthful edit summary.`` Response: ``As for J Greb's concern, I've made a request to be directed to the relevant rule on Wikipedia.``    noticing Asgardian's tendency for dishonesty, to then accuse anyone who points if out for ``incivility``, which given that he does what he always does makes it impossible to even respond:   Asgardian recently apparently systematically vandalising page-structures just to make a point, and various other users making a plea to finally shut him down:      Only the most recent situation of distorting profile content and deleting multiple references regardless that the information was entirely correct, and that the entire Talk population disagrees with him, and going by my experience on other pages such as Thanos he will eventually revert everything at a time when everyone else has mostly lost interest, even if he has to wait half a year to do so:    (This proved prophetic, as most recently  [warned] him of a ban if he continued to remove valid references, and he left the pages Dormammu alone for a few weeks after this, but then returned and did exactly the same thing all over again, despite that nobody agreed with him, with my main problem being that he essentially replaced referenced exact quotes with personal opinions.)  In addition, there was this old hint that he finds this behavior funny:  ````insidious misrepresentation``...heh. How old are you?``  That said, I have been reluctant to view him as a troll, since he does seem to try doing much more useful things than simply being a neverending nuisance for everyone in this ``community``, myself in particular, despite  asking me if I considered him as one given that some of his tactics correspond to those of a sophisticated troll, and have given him chance after chance to find compromises, and he has occasionally made minor attempts in this regard, but generally just completely reverts to the same version over and over. Recently we tried again, with the deal being that I'd keep my temper in check/stay as polite as I can, and give benefit of doubt, and him supposed to prove that he's willing to change, and turn more trustworthy and compromising.  I'd be fine with if he simply changed for the better, and stopped deleting references, or reinsert factual errors, and for a little while he seemed to make some effort in other cases such as The Stranger, but reasoning and compromises (i.e. rewrite the sentences for better structure if you wish, but keep valid references and accuracy cor"

If you suggest something you have to accpet the logic behind.
""""sadr"""" and polisario are located in Tindouf not in the so called """"free zone"""".
Their incursions in this region, which are partly internationally condemned, can not be seen as a fact that they are based their.
Therefore they should be treated in the Algerian page as Tindouf is in Algeria.
This is not my, but your logic. So you have to accept it, then we can make the change, in this AND in all the other articles, and start moving every thing based in Tindouf to Algeria, including polisario, """"sadr"""" and all their related articles.
If you do not accept this, then you have to drop the narrow focusing on the geogrpahic limits and start admitting that the crimes committed by polisario are done in relation to Western Sahara and therefore can be extended in this article.
=>This does not exclude though the central role of Algeria in these crimes and in the conflict in general
I do strongly dispute the """"free zone"""" thing in the talk page of the so called free zone. It is indeed no official nor recognized term, but a propaganda of Polisario and pro-polisario activits.

There will be scheduled meetings on every Tuesday at 14:00 in room 111. All group members are required to attend these meetings. Please remember that success of group projects highly depend upon productive group meetings, so please try to make every single one of them.
 
These meetings will start from next week, 6th October Tuesday. I would be heading the first meeting as the Chairperson and Sam would be the Secretory. The post of the chairperson and secretory would keep on rotating so that everyone is involved in this group project.
 
As discussed in today's meeting there are a few tasks that need to be addressed before the meeting on Tuesday, 6th October; which are as follows:
 
    *
      Setting up a Wiki Forum to have an effective group communication system and also providing easy access to the projectmaterial to all the group members. Tejal volunteered to set up the forum. All details of it will be passed on to all of you as soonas it is finished.
    *
      Coming up with conceptual design and ideas for the payload because as we all know payload is most important driver of thesatellite design, so ideally that would be the first step in our project.
    *
      Also please note down the email IDs of all the group members for future contact. And don't forget to buy a log book foryourselves.

0,"`. This explains why defecation is frequently accompanied by urination, and why urination is frequently accompanied by flatulence.  Defecation may be involuntary or under voluntary control. Young children learn voluntary control through the process of toilet training. Once this has been achieved, loss of control causing fecal incontinence may be caused by physical injury (such as damage to the anal sphincter that may result from an episiotomy), intense fright, excessive pressure placed upon the abdomen, inflammatory bowel disease, impaired water absorption in the colon (see diarrhea), and psychological or neurological factors.  The loss of voluntary control of defecation is experienced frequently by those undergoing a terminal illness.Joanne Lynn, MD. Merck.  October 2007.  Symptoms During a Fatal Illness.  Uploaded 3/1/09.   ==Posture aspects==     The positions and modalities of defecation are culture-dependent. The natural and instinctive method used by all primates, including humans for defecation, is the squatting position. Squat toilets, sometimes referred to as 'natural-position toilets', are still used by the vast majority of the world, including most of Africa, Asia and the Middle East.Kira A. The Bathroom. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1976, revised edition, pp.115,116.   The widespread use of seated-position toilets in the Western World is a recent development, beginning in the 19th century with the advent of indoor plumbing.A History of Technology, Vol.IV: The Industrial Revolution, 1750-1850. (C. Singer, E Holmyard, A Hall, T. Williams eds) Oxford Clarendon Press, pps. 507-508, 1958  Bockus Gastroenterology, the standard textbook on the subject, states: ``The ideal posture for defecation is the squatting position, with the thighs flexed upon the abdomen. In this way the capacity of the abdominal cavity is greatly diminished and intra-abdominal pressure increased, thus encouraging expulsion ...``Bockus. Gastroenterology. p. 754 2nd ed. Saunders, Philadelphia and London, 1964  ==Other considerations== The anus and buttocks may be cleansed with toilet paper, similar paper products, or other absorbent material. In some cultures water is used (e.g. as with a bidet or Lota (vessel)) either in addition or exclusively. In Japan and South Korea, some toilets known as washlets are designed to wash and dry the anus of the user after defecation (see anal cleansing).  ==References==   *Deeb, Benjamin (2004).  ``Healthy to the Core: How to Measure Effective Defecation.``  Greenwood Press. *Widmaier, Raff, Strang (2006). ``Vanders Human Physiology, the mechanisms of body function.

In fact, after delving into this rich assemblage of material, published in association with both the MCC and the ACS, it is probably true to say that this is the most important book of the past few decades. This claim is based on the fact that the author, who works at Exeter University, has meticulously unearthed many new details as well as hitherto unknown matches from the early 1700s. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis book draws heavily from newspapers, journals, letters and other documents housed in national and provincial collections, as well as other resources not generally available to, or used by, the majority of cricket historians, including history books, dictionaries, novels, plays and poems. Moreover, this is not a reworking of other writers contributions, as the author is not afraid to question previously published material or other works which have hitherto been accepted by historians as being chapter and verse on 18th century cricket. Indeed, this book includes more than 200 references to cricket which, until now, have never before been published whilst several errors and omissions have been carefully corrected and filled. One can only wonder at what further riches lie in the next three volumes of this series. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe work stemmed several years ago from the author’s desire to understand the relationship of the Hambledon Club’s exploits to the cricket which had preceded those illustrious days. What started out as a series of notes trying to disentangle what was fact and what was fiction has metamorphosed into a work which provides a sharper and more complete picture of the noble game than previously achieved by many previous authors as well as some of the great scholars of cricket history.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis period of tricorn hats, curved bats and two-stump wickets is vividly brought back to life by the year-by-year listing of references, supported by the accompanying notes and the series of beautifully reproduced images. As such, it is not a book which will be slavishly read time and again from cover to cover. Instead, it is a fantastic reference book with, as one would expect from someone with a strong academic background, a superb set of footnotes and bibliographical tools. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIndeed, in his accompanying notes, the publisher claims that this book “will assuredly become the premier recourse for anybody interested in early and 18th century cricket history.” I would unhesitatingly venture one step further and suggest that in years to come, the author’s name will be spoken of in the same breath as Haygarth, Waghorn or Buckley. High praise indeed, but so richly deserved.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENreview by Andrew Hignell"

0,"` ____________________________________________________________________________ == Headline text == Questions and comments  Ms. Barber wrote: ``In a united effort, the ISSR Licensed Breeders only produce approximately 200 pups per year``  '''''  Ms. Barber-How many of those puppies were ``produced`` by your kennel?  What specific health testing do you conduct on your dogs?  You, and those supporting your club/registry, have been respectfully asked for this information numerous times during this discussion yet you continue to ignore these legitimate requests, while appearing rude, insulting, superior-minded, and frankly an entirely offensive and inarticulate representative of this breed you ``founded`` and the other breeders affiliated with your registry.  I certainly hope other breeders affiliated with your organization do not present themselves to the public in the same way you do, as I can't imagine anyone with any intelligence and self-esteem would be willing to tolerate such unprofessional behavior, much less purchase any puppies/dogs from people who conduct themselves the way you have in this discussion.  You claim a lot, but you provide no independent support for your claims, only your own writings on your own website.  You claim anyone ``producing`` dogs other than you or your registry are frauds, yet you are unwilling to prove how this is true other than offering some photos YOU have taken of these dogs and your own rantings, as evidence. You claim breeders unaffiliated with you are ``in it for the money``, yet:  You produce more of these dogs than almost all other breeders combined, through your wholly and co-owned breeding dogs.  Your website (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/upcoming_litters.htm) for this Winter alone, shows you are ``producing`` ELEVEN litters at New Zion and through co-ownership breedings.  Eleven litters, even conservatively speaking, could easily produce over 100 PUPPIES!  And, you are planning for 20 more litters next Spring and Summer!  You also currently list over 25 stud dogs and over 25 females you are considering for breeding!  You charge a lot of money for each puppy you produce ($900-$2500+).  After the puppy-buyer has paid you for a puppy from a certain litter, you also contractually reserve the right, at your own discretion, to substitute a puppy from another ``compatible`` (again, based on your own determination) litter and you will not provide a refund if they are do not agree with the ``substitute`` puppy you decide to offer them. (see: http://www.newzionshilohs.org/Policies_N_Prices.htm.....``New Zion reserves the right to substitute any litter of equal/higher value that is compatible with your exact requirements``).  It appears that, once monies are given are given to you, your contract does not allow for any refund under any circumstances, nor could I find any instances where you contractually assume any financial responsibility whatsoever for any puppies you ``produce`` who display congenital/hereditary problems requiring resulting astronomical/extensive veterinary fees.    You require your puppy-buyers to not only pay you for puppies at the time you ``produce`` them, but you also require puppy-buyers to sign contracts promising future puppy and breeding rights (for breedable dogs, you require the dog's new owners to either give you some of the puppies that dog produces in the future and/or you require they allow you to use that dog in the future to sire new litters of your own), in order to profit from the dog not only now but also throughout his/her life.   You have no stated policy on your website page (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/Policies_N_Prices.htm) re: your own personal policy/commitment to rescue and make/find a home for for any of the puppies/dogs you ``produce``, should they become unwanted, homeless and/or end up in shelters or in abusive situations.  Your ``Policies and Prices`` make no mention of a contractual requirement by you (with the signed contractual commitment of your puppy-buyers) to spay/neuter their new ``pets``, in order to reduce overpopulation of this breed and dogs, in general.  I could find nowhere on your website where the horrifying statistics of unwanted/euthanzied dogs in the U.S. (2 million +, including 25% of which are purebred dogs) is responsibly addressed by someone actively promoting and engaged in the proliferation of this explosion.   Your website does not list any independent references, such as recommending/governing affiliations (i.e. Better Business Bureau), approval ratings (i.e. OFA, Penn-Hip, CERF), or other professional organizations to which you belong (ie. American Dog Owner's Association, the the Delta Society [therapy], dog training or agility organizations, etc.), only your own dog club(SSDCA), you own dog registry (ISSR), and your own "

Thousands of refs cite leaching in many contexts but almost none in respect of food oils. I understand that Leaching as in Parboiling  """"Parboiling can also be used for removing poisonous or foul-tasting substances from foodstuffs...."""" is used as a preparation for removing taints in oils (can't find refs here either), but this is NOT an extraction method. 

 ::3. The maceration confusion is already here at []. Making flavoured oils isn't what this article is about, surely? Merely the briefest reference to the page on them should do: this article is surely essentially about the base oils used to make the flavoured oils.

Rather than familiarize himself with film project guidelines, as I suggested a few days ago, Camboy8 seems to be intent on ignoring them.

I asked him why, and he responded, """"To answer your personal question on why this is the only article I edit, I am not a very involved editor, but Nathan Gamble is my favorite actor, So when someone is taking out what takes me a long time to edit, It bothers me.

Nowhere is there any official statement that the EU is not a member.

This sentence in many sources follows on from the sentence that says that countries are represented by their Head of State/Government and is needed simply because the EU does not have a Head of State/Government. It doesn't mean anything else.  **(5) Lucy-marie further quotes ``The EU does not take part in G8 political discussions``. Of course it doesn't: it would be quite wrong for the President of the Commission to do this since the EU cannot have a single view on these issues, being an association of many countries (some of which are represented in the G8 anyway).  **(6) Nowhere is there a source saying that the EU is not a member.

 The following was moved do discussion because it was not in encyclopedic style and had few citations.  Also, citations were not in proper format. 

 == Other modern Modifications of Kondratieff theory == 

 === The contest of Political Long Cycles vs. Economic Long Cycles === 

 The theory of long cycles tend to generate much debate during periods of so-called """"recessions"""", while during the long periods of growth decreases instead the intensity of the debate. Since the 1970s and above 1980s, the discussions increased quite hugely, when they were relatively faded between 1945 and 1970. It is questionable whether the period since 1967 (Meadows Report), or 1971 (end of gold convertibility of the dollar) or 1973 (oil shocks) is a long recession. The US economy has experienced strong productivity gains and a period of economic growth in length as yet unknown, from the years 1980s. As for Asia, this continent started to take off ever since. But Europe has actually experienced the problems of mass unemployment and slower growth since the 1970s. Yet the theory of long cycles then experienced an upturn, but in all over directions than before. These long cycles would be not economic, but also political. It is not only cycles of political views, but cycles involving the world via their geopolitical dimension. And Modelski (1983) and Goldstein (1988) are interpreting and completing the Kondratiev results. In parallel with Kondratiev economic long waves, exist in parallel hegemonic cycles. Hegemonic cycle lasts two successive Kondratiev cycles (120 years) by Modelski, or between two and three cycles (150 years) by Goldstein. 

 === Neo-Schumpeterian Approaches vs. World System Approaches === 

 In fact, in Europe itself, the theory of hegemonic long cycles initiated notably by Modelski and Goldstein, has long had less success in starting a debate in Universities, than the theories about economic long cycles lasting approximately 50 years. The real debate has often opposed rather - since the 1970s and especially 1980s - neo-Schumpeterian on one hand, with advocates of the theory of the World System on the other hand. It is true though that the World System Approach accepts more the idea of a possible existence of political long cycles. Among the neo-Schumpeterian, Kleinknecht conducted audits of the econometric theory of Kondratiev, country by country, and concludes we can consider this theory as widely tested empirically. On the other hand, proponents of the theory of the World System note that this theory does not oppose only developed countries on one hand, developing countries on the other side. It is also showed, in developed countries themselves, the presence of growing inequalities in income and endowment factors, between neighboring regions: through the establishment of systems for the construction of suitable qualifications, the long cycle and the global system naturally spread inequalities locally, according to the international division of labor. Gerhard Mensch's works can be proved to be in part as a link between these theories. On the one hand he argues for a neo-Schumpeterian explanation of the long cycles of innovation. On the other hand, since it explains that innovations through credit systems adapted to recognize the global evolution, may exist in periods of expansion like in recession periods, it justifies the fact that innovations can be supported by the public sector, for example in a recession and to increase the average skill level. 

 === Methodological Enquiries === 

 Assume that the findings made in the early days of the theory of economic long cycles (early twentieth century and even a little before) show points of support to build statistical systems, that are conceived in order to verify the theory. What are these points of support? On the one hand, the various economic sectors vehicle some productivity differentials. Thanks to the knowledge of these differentials... we could understand how the credit spreads from a sector of the economy to another to feed growth. But if we reason, not taking into account the sectoral point of view, but rather from a national perspective, we will not have that subtelty. It is this subtelty that allows the construction of econometric systems to resolve the question. If we can understand the phenomenon of growth only nationally is one possibility; there economy and law are used to walk closely together. But it must go global to move towards the solution in terms of the method how to conceptually integrate the global innovation? Should it be, to hope to achieve, and solve, again... a question of method! Indeed, early theories of long cycles rather studied the issue of price changes for each country, and also in some respects suggested modest ways to incorporate the issue of quantity or income. Now if we come to the world"

 Tyrannosaurus FA 

Hi Sandy, I was wondering if you would have a quick look at the Tyrannosaurus article and see if it looks to you to meet current FA standards?  I am wondering whether to initiate a discussion on it with a view towards it needing an FA review as the text to me seems repetitive, handling of units hap-hazard and inconsistent, significant overlinking, and needing some reorganisation.  I would welcome any thoughts you may have, and to be clear I am not asking that you take on the job, I just seek the view of an experienced FA contributor.  Thanks.    
 Hi, EdChem ... I'm sorry I have been of so little use in responding to your requests for help lately !  I've been quite busy in real life, so haven't had the time for the sustained commitment needed to review at the FA level, although I can occasionally dip in to DYK for a quick source review.  (Will respond to Tony's DYK issue as soon as I can I'm more concerned about sourcing, padding, and copyvio issues than how interesting hooks are at DYK I think interesting hooks might be a concern if the basic pillars of Wikipedia were being met, and I'm concerned that DYK is still a place where not even basic pillars that apply to all articles are upheld.)   When I was new to Wikipedia, dinosaur articles were all the rage; as often happens, it seems that many of the editors who maintained those articles have moved on.  At a quick glance, I can see numerous problems (as you outlined, including uncited text) with the article, but those problems aren't as bad as many older FAs that typically appear at WP:FAR.  It's not surprising that a high-profile topic like tyrannosaurus would deteriorate after its principle editors move on. Instructions at FAR ask that editors post to the talk page before initiating a review, in hopes that some interested editor will improve the article and remove the need for FAR.  You cannot go wrong by listing some of the obvious issues on talk to see if anyone will surface to work on the article.  If no one surfaces in say a month, I agree that the article probably needs to go to FAR.  But there are so many FAs in so much worse shape ... I digress )  Best,  (Talk)

0,"Comment on Implementations 

There is 3rd common way of implementing deques and that is as an array of pointers to fixed sized pages of the elements (usually a power of 2, even 1 element) The advantage of this scheme is that if new elements are inserted at the front or end of the deque, pages containing elements in the middle of the deque need not be disturbed. Nearly all the C++ vendor implement in this fashion. Note also: The C++ deque cannot be implemented using an array. There is a requirement that references to elements in the middle of a deque remain valid if only the only thing done to the deque is add new elements at either end. An array implementation would fail when the array needs to be reallocated."

0,"`=Some small communist and fascist groups are definitely cults. Some larger ideological groups may contain a cultic core or special formations organized in a cult-like fashion (according to some accounts, the Third International operatives from various countries in the 1930s were treated virtually as cult zombies by Stalin's cynical bureaucrats). Arguably, Himmler's SS included cultic formations trained at that castle (Wewelsburg?) where they supposedly performed something called the ceremony of the stifling air (possibly this is a street legend). As to North Korea it is definitely a totalitarian state with an intense leader-cult religion (probably the most intense such formation that has ever existedone hesitates to describe it as a Stalin-style personality cult since even Stalin never strove for such a level of quasi-religious worship and regimentation). But I'm not sure the term ``political cult`` is appropriate in reference to North Korea, since the term has been used up until now exclusively to refer to relatively small groups that don't wield state power and that employ elaborate psychological manipulation of their followers as a substitute for the patronage and secret-police power of a post-revolutionary state.Dking (Dennis King), 2 Sept 2006  ==`"

The term mascot may apply, but as a secondary description to the preferred term. I do not wish to exclude the term mascot, simply to place it as secondary to the preferred term. Additionally I present other arguments. *Chicago El is called so by the local population. However outside of Chicago, most people would call the system a """"rapid transit system"""" and later in the article it is in fact described as such. In the opening paragraph clear preference is given to the local name even though consensus among the wider world community is that it is a rapid transit system. *What about Chief Osceola from FSU? In that article he is described as a symbol, there is zero mention of mascot. I would argue that the performance of Chief Osceola is identical in spirit to the performance of Chief Illiniwek.

On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book ``Historical Sight Through Thesprotia``, edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that ``The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek`` .NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDuring the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga. There were hundreds of other missing persons. In the same period, as a result of Greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the Albanian population of Chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses and places of worship were burned down or destroyed. Furthermore, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region who took refuge in the Republic of Albania.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Albanian government, after the war, took the Cham issue to the Peace Conference in Paris. The conference of Foreign Ministers of the Allied Powers not only recognized the very difficult circumstances the Chams were subjected to, but also demanded repatriation and recovery of their property. The International Investigation Commission of the United Nations, appointed for the verification of the tragedy on both sides of the border, concluded its report in 1946-1947, replete with facts and evidence about the massacre and painful tragedy of the Cham people.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRealities of the recent history of Chameria require the attention of the international community. Greece cannot avoid but recognize the genocide of the Cham Albanians. The civil and legal rights of those currently living in Greece, estimated around 100.000 today, must be respected by Greece. According to the official Greek stand, the muslim population of Chameria, which numbers around 150.000 and still refugees in Albania will never be allowed to return to Greece because they allegedly collaborated with the German occupiers during the Second World War. They are considered as war criminals according to the Greek laws (K.Mitsotakis, Tirana, May 1992).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis hypothesis is untrue and fabricated. To consider a whole community as criminals, many members of which died in Greece's liberation struggle in the Second World War, is a political and historical crime against Cham Albanians. In 1994, the Parliament of the Albanian Republic proclaimed 27 June 1944 as the commemoration day for the massacred Albanians of Chameria, and a monument was built up in Konispol in memory of the victims of Chameria.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAfter 1945, with a view to changing the demographic structure of Chameria, its colonization with Greeks, Aromens and Gypsies was begun. Greece wanted the demographic structure of the province changed because it did not trust the rest of the Albanian population who remained there, even though they were of the Orthodox confession. Greece violently put an end to every attempt to preserve the identity of the Albanian population of the Orthodox belief and Albanian was prohibited to be spoken in public. Thereby, the assimilation of orthodox Albanians gained momentum. The fate of the orthodox Albanians was not much different than that of their Muslim brothers when it came to maintaining their ethnic identity.

Let's start over...

This is not going anywhere, except towards mediation. Though I agree more or less completely with Justin's edits, you both need to calm down. The spelling/language issue is pointless, as are the insults, as are the reverts, and the misleading and/or rude edit summaries. Who cares which version is online for two or three hours, if it's going to be reverted anyway once this debate is completed? So let's focus on the debate, and leave the page at some point where we are all familiar with the content, and then do changes step-by-step. To improve the mood here, I think Daryou should accept that there may be some spelling errors in his texts, while Koavf really needs to respect that Daryou's not a native speaker, and not harass him over this. (And I need to stop sounding like my mom.)
 Mincom, the Moroccan government's own site, is of course propaganda, by every definition of the word, but that doesn't mean it can't be used as a source - for what Morocco's government thinks and says. On the other hand, pasting hole chunks of text from it as fact, is obviously not how this should be done.
 Inserting that Western Sahara was """"peacefully ... liberated"""" by Morocco is also betraying an agenda that is far more biased than your edits have been so far, Daryou. I think you've been trying to make that point all along, consistently in all of your edits, but you used to be better at hiding it.
 Questions remain above to be answered, with arguments, not reverts or insults.
 That's my input for today, and, yes, I think mediation could be a good thing. I was hoping we could settle this one through discussion (it has worked before!), but I've lost hope by now.

Alright, first of all. Let's stop inventing nonsense out of the air. And blatant lying have no place here either. Remember that *any controversial unsourced material* will be challenged and removed as per WP:Verifiability. Now, that everyone knows that, we can hopefully start a sensible and reasonable discussion on Seoul again. I will start with pointing out some very basic mistakes here:
The reference everyone seems to quote  has no mention of this invented system called """"Seoul Subway Line 1-9"""". Strictly speaking, it lists lines owned by Seoul City's government. 
That reference also says that Line 7 extension to Incheon is to open by late 2012, which it did. Since it is outdated, the true number is 327km.
Gyeongchun has no grade crossings (Terra is still remembering the now passed away Gyeongchun line from the 80s) and will never have KTX service (which he is again confusing with Wongju-Ganneung Line, a separate line under construction exclusively for HSR)
Gyeongbu Line for the metro service of Line 1 operate on a separate track, hence no track sharing. 
Gyeongin - Are you kidding me? Freight and intercity trains? Where is that nonsense coming from? This is an exclusive metro line with no other traffic whatsoever. This line is metro exclusive. How old are you? I mean like you seem to remember Seoul from the 80s or something.

Now, I have addressed the issues above assuming that track sharing is not allowed, which is an invented original research as raised by BsBsBs. Looking back at the sources..neither APTA nor USDT make any mention of that. The 2011 UITP source does mention something similar to it in a footnote saying that """"networks that are functionally separate from the rest of the rail system"""" are basically metros from what I understand. Now remember they say """"functionally"""" - not """"track sharing"""". That's because the Korean government's legal law defines Line 1's Gyeongbu section for example, as a metro because it has a dedicated track on its own that follow the same path as the intercity trains next to it. In other words, it is functionally separate from the rest of the railway system and hence meets UITP's definition, which is very Eurocentric by the way. Seoul Metro and SMRT are members of UITP, so clearly track sharing is absent from their definitions. But functionally separate is present. And this is exactly how things should be done. And this 10 minute rule is completely absent anywhere in UITP/APTA or USDT and was voted out by consensus by multiple users (except IJBall). Legally, Incheon Subway is part of the metro system, so there's no doubt in including that as I have mentioned before with the legal sources. From what I know, Korail will be completely updating their website on April 1st, with the new updated data for their subways. So we will have direct numbers for all of Korail's metros pretty soon. The issue of sorting metros by systems and not by operators, is something that is not agreed with here. It would require a name change on this article. This will need external consensus and is something we will deal at a later time.   """

The only thing I know about this band is that the ``nu metal`` label seems to be erroneous. I may be wrong, but that's what I read throughout archives. I also think other bands such as Sum 41 shouldn't be included in this list because they are only backed by one source or two. Just because one person decided to call them this way is not enough.

Keep in mind that in determining proper weight we consider a viewpoint's prevalence in reliable sources, not its prevalence among Wikipedia editors.  If you are able to prove something that few or none currently believe, Wikipedia is not the place to premiere such a proof.  Once a proof has been presented and discussed elsewhere, however, it may be referenced. See: Wikipedia:No original research and Wikipedia:Verifiability."

It may not read smoothly there, and may have more photos than necessary, but I put a cleanup tag there and certainly the minority of people who wanted this page to be able such contests can go there and clean it up to their liking.  I redirected this term to photo manipulation article, as it was more in line with what the term meant (though technically Adobe Photoshop would have made more sense, but we have to go with consensus I guess). It appears someone else just moved photo manipulation elsewhere, so that may have to get cleaned up later.   But, bottomline here is that the Photoshopping article no longer exists, as it was clear from discussion that it never should have in the first place but that a few editors with misplaced motives ignored for a long time and edit warred across several articles over. Kind of sucks that even an admin or two was involved, but then I guess even admins can make mistakes and work in bad faith.  "

I think the section ought to stay included  it's part of Arod's historical record that he's come under fire for being ``un-clutch`` (ludicrous as those criticisms may have been). I'm also going to remove the tag suggesting integrating the section elsewhere  the section hardly gives undue weight to the controversy, which extended over a period of several years and occupied who-knows-how-many back pages in the sports press.    == Range Factor ==  The range factor claims currently tagged as as ``citation needed`` can be verified on ESPN's page (and probably elsewhere). The claims as stated are accurate and verifiable. I'd add the cite, but on second thought I question whether it's really a useful thing to state. It makes it sound like that's the final word on his defense, which it surely isn't. Range factor isn't the only defensive stat, and A-Rod does not rank last on many of the others. To cite it exclusively feels like you're trying to push a point of view criticizing him defensively. (Also, even on range factor, in 2004 and 2005 he was tied for last, not alone.)     == ``Youngest to hit 600`` ==  This stat is misleading, while he may be the youngest to achieve this he took an above average time to do so. He played 183 more games than Babe Ruth. Because Rodriguez started playing baseball at a much earlier age than many of the greats should be noted. He is a good player, but statements concerning his age should be taken out. Games played/Seasons are a better barometer of talent than age.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by      ="

 Note that the link to Larson, Ron is not red, but all that article actually says is that Ron Larson wrote the Calculus of a Single Variable: Early Transcendental Functions book. And I doubt that guy did anything else as remarkable as to be worth writing in here.

0,"`== moved from article ==  ' With the fall of Nazi Germany, the White Rose came to represent the purest form of opposition to tyranny, with no interest in personal power or self-aggrandizement. Their story became so well-known that the composer Carl Orff, attempting to justify his remaining in Germany during the war, claimed to his Allied interrogators that he was a founding member of the White Rose and released. While he was personally acquainted with Huber, there is no evidence that Orff was in any way involved in the movement, and he most likely made his claim to escape imprisonment. '  :I would like to see some documentation of this, and even if it is provided the POV, assumptions and general maligning of Mr. Orff will need to be removed.  [Spade]   ::http://www.h-net.org/~german/articles/dennis1.html ; A more detailed account of Orff's connections to the Nazis belongs into his encyclopedia entry. Appart from the wishy-washy first sentence, the rest can probably be re-added to the article. -    ::Please also list the ``POV, assumptions, and general maligning``. -    :::I don't see this passage as POV.  As for the specifics, if it's not generally accepted then it should be sourced to the Kater article.  When it's restored to the article, the word ``was`` should be inserted before ``released``.    == Excessive linking ==  I just deleted a bunch of internal links on ordinary, well recognised, English words ... before reverting these please read Wikipedia:Make only links relevant to the context.  Note that for links to be helpful they should be relevant to the context of the current article.  Links to broad and general concept definitions do not fall in that category.  :Having read the page you cite, and also the comments disagreeing with it, I'm restoring the link to treason.  There are other links that have some value, but this is the one I feel strongly about.  One can make a colorable argument for either side of the charge that these students were guilty of treason, and the reader might want an elaboration of the concept.  In fact, the article on treason could usefully be expanded by consideration of cases such as this one, in which someone acts in the interests of the nation but against the commands of the regime now in power.    == Why a link to goat.cx? ==  Above the display of the article is a `you have new messages' link which takes me to www.goat.cx.  It isn't above other articles.  And it doesn't appear in the articles source.  :That was vandalism and has been removed.  If you see it appear again, remove it again.    == European federalist bias ==  What evidence exists that the White Rose collectively ``believed in a federated Europe``?  :This is mentioned in the fifth leaflet.    == Prussian militarism? ==  Why is there mention of Prussian militarism? Is this an opinion expressed by White Rose people? Otherwise it might just as well read ``the national-socialist glorification of violence``, ``Germany's role as aggressor`` or whatever. It might even be argued that putting Prussian militarism on the same level as Nazi aggression is an insult to Prussian militarism. Anyway, it seems POV to me.    Not if you believe that Prussian Militarism was the seedbed for Nazism or at least that when Nazism came to power the infrastructure, culture or mindset of Prussian Militarism in place was perfectly suited to being used to their ends. The Prussian belief that society should be structured around military lines, that war and expansion was the goal and that unwavering belief in the line of command had to come before morality played right into the Nazis hands. So the link should stay, I think.  `"

0,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Until a ``competent tribunal`` determines his status isn't he entitled to POW treatment ? ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENArticle 5 of the third geneva convention says prisoners are entitled to a competent tribunal to determine their status.  The Bush administration tried to say that it lay within the President's powers to rule that anyone captured in ``the war on terror`` was not entitled to the protections of the Geneva Conventions.  But the USA has three branches of government, with checks and balances, and that ruling was over-ruled.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Bush administration resisted providing the detainees with a ``competent tribunal``.  When they could no longer do so they implemented the Combatant Status Review Tribunals.  However, the mandates of the CSRT fell short of what the Geneva Conventions requires for a ``competent tribunal``.  So, so far as I can determine, Hicks, and all the other detainees, currently remain entitled to the full protections of POW status.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe July 17 ruling by the three judge panel said that Hamdan's ``military commission`` could serve double duty, and also serve as his ``competent tribunal``.  But he and Hicks haven't had their military commissions yet.  So they are still entitled to the protections of the Geneva Conventions.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf Hicks had carried a gun, and shot at Northern Alliance forces, but while doing so, qualified as a lawful combatant, who would argue those activities were crimes?  That is what much of the GCs are about.  Activities that, if conducted by random citizens, would be crimes, are not crimes if a soldier does them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI knew a guy who was a veteran of the Spanish Civil War.  He fought in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  Franco, with the support of Hitler, and Mussolini, was trying to take over the democratically elected government of Spain.  Thousands of volunteers, from around the world, made their way to Spain to fight fascism.  George Orwell was one of them.  Although he didn't enlist in the International Brigades.  He enlisted in a militia.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWas fighting fascism a good thing?  Well, it was a good thing a few years later, during World War 2.  I think it was a good thing in 1938 too.  The good guys lost that one.  Franco won.  And Spain was a fascist dictatorship for the next 30 years.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI don't believe in extreme fundamentalist Islam.  Or any kind of Islam.  But, it seems to me that the foreigners who went to Afghanistan, Bosnia or Chechnya, to help free fellow muslims, from foreign oppression, were doing something similar to what the volunteers who went to Spain were doing.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDo foreigners enlist in the US Army?  Yes.  And President Bush moved to reward them, by offering them a fast track to citizenship.  But foreigners have always served in the US forces.  Several tens of thousands of individual Canadians crossed the border to enlist and fight in Vietnam.  If the Viet Cong captured one of them, should they have been treated as an ``illegal combatant`` because they were not American soldiers?  What about the French Foreign Legion?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think the precedent is clear.  Hicks not being an Afghan did not preclude him from enlisting in the Afghan Army.  Was the Taliban Army a real, national Army?  The Bush administration says it wasn't.  But is President Bush's mere say-so enough?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN=== What about those uniforms ? ===NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe uniforms in the US forces, and those of all modern industrialized states are quite, well, ``uniform``.  The US soldier doesn't just have a regulation helmet, and regulation bullet proof vest and combat blouse, but he has regulation pants, boots, belt, backpack.  And probably regulation socks, undershirts and underpants too.  But that is not what the Geneva Convention requires.  The Geneva Convention merely requires that they wear something that clearly identifies them as combatants, not civilians.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOver on a blog site, about two years ago, I asked the other readers how much of a uniform ordinary Americans would have to don if the USA were invaded by, let's say, Cuba, and all the official uniforms were tied up in Iraq.  Some people thought a special armband would be sufficient.  One guy said T-shirts with the American flag on them would not be sufficient, because civilians wear those too.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDuring the afghan war, when we caught glimpses of Northern Alliance forces, they certainly weren't wearing modern, head to toe, style uniforms.  If the identification they were wearing was merely a special vest, or scarf, or hat, then that is all that should be required of Hicks or Hamdan.`"

edit conflictMy Dear (though Furioso) Orlando: In the first diff,  has left you a message about """"Masem’s talk.""""  In my world, a """"talk"""" is a public lecture, typically given at a conference, convention, or educational institution. As you may recall, I gave one of these at Southampton last month on a topic of mutual interest.  In light of that, and of Masem’s Signpost article, I supposed that   referred to something of a similar nature that Masem had delivered. Asking for the citation seemed that natural and polite thing to do. It turns out, Vordox meant """"Masem’s talk page""""; I've seldom seen that usage in Wikipedia or elsewhere.  I see Vordox is active on Twitter, where they have 129 tweets to their 3 followers and conversations with TotalBiscuit, Masem, CH Sommers,and SargonOfAkkad ; say hi for me!

In the second diff, I am attempting to address concisely a long, long series of talk page contributions, many of them of late by a single editor, which argue for including additional marginal sources sympathetic to Gamergate.  In this particular response, I am pointing out that relaxed standards might have surprising effects, and I use the name of the predominant editor as a metonym for the argument. 

I might also mention that I myself have not complained  at least not publicly  of the numerous efforts that have been made to personalize the dispute on Gamergate's behalf, both on-wiki and off, including previous sections on this talk page, elsewhere on Wikipedia, and at 8chan and reddit and in press releases and correspondence.

0,"  ===In Response===  Dear “Lessheard vanU” and to Wikipedia including all editors and administrators & Mr. Wales:   This is a very serious issue.  We contributing writers have attempted to follow wikipedia written polices in contributing and adding to an existing article or creating one.  Yet there are double standards beings upheld by wikipedia’s own editors and administrators.  As with Blackpearl14, who clearly believes that wikipedias polices don’t apply to her, and with other editors who uphold double standards.   Then when challenged to the double standards, including Blackpearl14's violation of wikipedia’s own written polices and reckless authoritarian rule and control, other wikipedia editors and administrators then support each other when one of them continues to violate wikipedia’s own written polices.    “Lessheard vanU” had then wrongly and deliberately calls the contributing people who writes back and flags the issue at hand a “harassing the editor”, outright agreeing with Blackpearl14.  Then in addition to IP address being blocked, all “talk & discussion” are deleted  leaving only one sided bias and reckless claims against the contributing writers.  Even though wrongly deleted by wikipedia editors & administrators, all of this has been recorded, including that Blackpearl14 having repeatedly writing in both correspondence and her bio page (copies have been secure)  that the articles belong to her and they will continue to be own and controlled by her.  These statements alone proves that she is in violation of wikipedia’s own written polices and purpose.  Yet you have ignored that.   As previously written in discussion, per wikipedia’s own written polices, but immediately deleted by Blackpearl14 and then sanctioned by  “Lessheard vanU”, Blackpearll4 - calls herself evidently Mrs. Johnny Depp and Pirate lord-ess and such.  She celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean for wikipedia.   Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages, and then recklessly calls anyone who doesn’t follow her bias views vandals, attackers and such.   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral and is against wikipedia’s own written polices.  Sorry, but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.   As recorded, Blackpearl14's pages regarding this issue are one sided, not neutral, are bias, in conflict of interest and are all promotional tools promoting the causes and products of the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean.   Yes, Pirates of the Caribbean and similar wikipedia articles are not neutral, they are a series of one sided promotional pages including links to products and causes of the Walt Disney Company.   Following wikipedia’s own written “neutral” policy, entire articles would have to be deleted.    Yet Blackpearl14 continues to violate Wikipedia polices and purpose.     Then with IP’s being deliberately blocked and contributing writers having been wrongly accused and falsely called various things, if anyone then attempts to generate a new article related to Pirates of the Caribbean following wikipedia’s own written polices, editors and administrators gang up and generate false reason upon reason, to delete those articles and ban the IP user.   They use a countless list of double standards and twisted logic to justify their reckless acts.   It’s a total lock out by the editors and administrators, abusing their trust tools, acting like a private monarchy.   To date, Blackpearl14's has proven she has ultimate control, has repeatedly stated that is her purpose, and had even sought to have the articles locked.    Then you “Lessheard vanU” wrote that you don’t want to lock these articles, stating it goes against company policy, but yet you added that you are preparing to possibly lock the articles in some capacity and do other acts against those who have been falsely branded and wrongly labeled as “vandals” and “harassing the editors” etc...   Other editors and administrators who have proven their practice of bias and manipulative and outright double standards practices include “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and “Chris Mann”.   We have documented that they say one thing, yet practice another.   We have documented that they enforce one set of wikipedia polices yet discard and ignore those same policies when it applies to themselves or their selective circle of peers.   We contributing writers also wonder just how many editors and admin"

Hi

Earlier today I noticed that there is no article on Amcom, and I posted on the Amnet talk page, before moving it to talk:Amcom (because although the network is called Amnet, the actual company is called Amcom).
I didn't realize until later that there was already an Amcom (actually Amnet) page that had been deleted. After reading the explanation for the deletion, I'm not sure whether Amcom really has enough notability or not. However, if we do want to make an Amcom page we will have to supply some secondary sources to justify the company's notability.

If you are still interested, take a look at this article I found: 

If you want to reply to me, make sure you either reply on my talk page, or leave a note there saying that you have replied elsewhere. Otherwise, I won't know that you've replied.

 """"Jesus and Messianic prophecy"""" 

Hey. I don't know if this is technically where I should be posting this; sorry if it's not.

1) Fine, if """"retort"""" isn't 100% appropriate then I'll use """"counter-argue""""- that is the meaning I was trying to get across.

But I think all your other points are too strict and therefore not in keeping with Wikipedia's guidelines or encyclopedia guidelines in general.

2) You said: """"Christians retort that the messianic prophecies never specified a time-line for the Messiah's actions, and the New Testament, especially the Book of Revelation, detail how some of the prophecies will come to fruition later. . This is a bit vague and raises some questions. Which Christians? Where did they say that? How did they detail it? Can you reference it from a notable/semi-notable scholar?""""

First, I can't point to a place in the Old Testament where the time-line DOESN'T exist, you know what I mean? There is no Jewish time-line so it cannot be referenced. But the New Testament does have a Christian time-line, as detailed in the Book of Revelation. Now, which Christians hold to this belief? Essentially all of them- all that have a moderate to literal interpretation of the Bible, which is essentially all. Where did Christian authors detail this belief? In the Bible! How did they detail it? They wrote it in the Bible!!! That is why I made Bible references! Which scholar can I quote? How about John the Apostle, who wrote Revelation? Is one of the founders of Christianity an acceptable source on the subject?

I find you taking objection to this equivalent to someone writing, """"Christians believe Jesus came back from the dead, as detailed in various places, including the gospels,"""" and then you coming around asking for scholarly sources and not accepting Bible passages and asking, """"which Christians believe that?"""". 

3) You said: This includes Jesus ruling an earthly paradise after the apocalypse (Revelation 19-22). , although it does reference The Bible, if left alone, it sounds rather confusing. It also does not specifically reference a line from Revelation, nor does it reference which version of The Bible it quotes (King James, NIV, etc) which could mean a slight difference in the quote. 

If you want many specific Bible quotes then I'll put those in, and I'll list if its KJV or whatever. But I don't think that's required as my broad citation of Rev 19-22 does clearly explain exactly what I'm talking about, including a physical kingdom on earth, a messianic age of righteousness and so on. Just because I didn't dissect it and show a specific line for each point doesn't mean they aren't there- any interested reader can easily find them by reading those chapters.

If I had written, """"The story of Noah's Ark is in Genesis 6-9,"""" would you have deleted my entry and said its citation is too vague? Just because I didn't give a synopsis with ten references doesn't mean it's unworthy; just look it up! 

4) What bothers me most is how this whole thing started when I tried to correct incorrect data on your site (the line that Christians don't believe in a physical resurrection). That line had NO references! So even if my references are vague they still trump the initial post, don't they? You can't delete my post for dubious citation then restore something with no references at all.

5) I'm sure you'll disagree with me on this one, but most of all, I think that my contribution didn't need to cite ANYTHING as it is such common knowledge that Christians believe in Judgment Day, an age of peace etc. I feel like I'm in some kind of twilight zone defending this belief. 

It's almost as bad as someone posting, """"Christians don't believe Jesus was tried, executed and came back to life,"""" then I post that they do, citing Luke 20-24, then you saying that it is too vague etc. It was pure courtesy to give the citation- it's such common knowledge that Christians believe these things!

But whatever- I'll repost with a several more-specific quotes. And BTW, you may think, """"Whoa, this guy care WAY too much about Wikipedia (and I'm a mod),"""" but this is about preventing my religion from being misrepresented. (And I hate inconsistency.)

It may sound strange, but Wikipedia requires that all information in articles (especially biography articles of living persons) be sourced to published, reliable sources that other people can reference to verify the information in the articles.  Saying that some information you add to an article is based on 'privileged' knowledge is really not allowed on Wikipedia, because what you are saying is that you know something that nobody else could know or verify.

0,"`  ::I understand your point. I simply do not believe it to be valid. During the period in question, the RC Church did not have large armies at its disposal. It relied on secular powers to take heed of its views. In France, Louis, a loyal Catholic hated the concept of religious toleration. The RC Church, at this time, were also opposed to this principle (one that has become so widely accepted in 'western' societies that it is often difficult to imagine a time before). Louis, with the tactic support of leading Churchman, ordered acts of anti-Protestant terror. (Let's be completely honest, without the tactic approval of the Church, would a devout Catholic have been committed to such a course of action?) Some leading Churchman celebrated the outcome - a France almost completely 'cleansed' of Protestants. Now, in all the material the criticism of the RC Church is so obviously implied that this shouldn't need re-emphasising. A modern historian would not write: ``The following is a criticism of the RC Church...`` That is how junior school children begin their English composition answers!   `"

Rather than keep the poor structure, and use that poor structure as justification for excluding the pronunciation, I favor correcting the the lede.  It is customary for the opening bolded text of an article to match the article's page name.  For this article the title and opening bold text do not match, which is unusual, and as a result other aspects of the opening paragraph will necessarily be affected."

0,", 11 July 2006 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::Well Maybe theres a reason it was taken off. I think its because her voice isnt as good as it used to be. but still I say her range is Bb2-G#7 but all that can be proven is a range of C3-G#7. C3 is the lowest note in My All, Emotions, You're So Cold, and I believe other songs. A1 is my lowest note and F7 is my highest and Im a Lyric Baritone. I don't know if Mariah has ever sang above the piano or in the second octave because there is no audio to prove it. All I know is alot of people exaggerate her voice alot. Notes should be checked before saying what they are. People start rumors about alot of things like the note in You're So Cold being G2. Its not. My way of checking notes is by using a keyboard. its pretty accurate too. Its better than a tuner. Tuners can be thrown off by the slightest extra sound. the best way to check a note using a tuner is to copy the note by singing it yourself. But keyboards are easy cause it wont produce a note an octave lower or anything as most people tend to do if they feel a note is too high or an octave higher if the note is too low. You should always check a note yourself and ask another person if you can rely on them.  06:27"

 ==Federal elections charts== 
 I’d like to get some consensus on what to do about colours in the elections charts, but I don’t want to get into a revert war, so I’m asking people to express their opinions here before any changes are made. Since you have contributed to these pages, I’m inviting your comments. 
 I am initiating this discussion because some of the colours that are currently being used are too dark for some monitors so that it is difficult to read the text. The point of adding colours to the charts is to make it easier for readers to derive information from the charts. This goal is foiled by using colours dark enough to obscure the text. The Wikipedia style guide is clear on the issue:  
 :Use colour sparingly. Computers and browsers vary: you cannot know how much colour is presented on the recipient's machine if any. Wikipedia is international: colours have different meaning in different cultures. Too many colours on one page make them look cluttered and unencyclopedic. Use the colour red only for alerts and warnings.  

 So let’s choose some colours that are light enough that red Wilkilinked text and blue Wikilinked text are both easy to read through. 

 Please join the discussion at: Talk:Canadian federal election results since 1867. Thanks,  17:23, 18"

 == MI Ridership == 

 Under the section Michigan Ridership it is claimed that """"Amtrak's Michigan services are now the most profitable lines in the U.S."""" 

 I believe the Northeast Corridor is the most profitable.  Michigan services are still subsudized, its just that their ridership increase has been so great that it saved the state of MI about a million dollars in subsudies. 

 See: http://www.southbendtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061124/News01/611240396/-1/NEWS01 

 I also was unaware that there will definately be improvements for higher speed service - I knew that the state was seeking it, but the federal government had not yet approved the funds, as far as I know.

 The warehouse, run down and seemingly abandoned, stood surrounded by closed-down factories and deserted storefronts. Most of the streetlights in the area had long ago burned out, or had been busted, so that the only light shining on it came from a sickly-looking sickle moon. 

 The inside of it wasn't any better. One whole side was filled with half-rotten cardboard boxes, stacked floor to ceiling in derelict piles. Heavy tarps covered the broken windows, and flapped loosely against the night wind. Debris was spread out throughout the otherwise empty floor, except for a section that had been recently cleaned off. 

 There, slumped against a support beam and seemingly unconscious, was a man. A single chair was propped a few feet away in front of him, surrounded by a number of floor lamps. These were turned off at the moment, but extension cords led off towards the darkened wall. 

 The man's head lolled weakly.  

 A door opened on the far end, and three men entered. The one in the middle walked a couple of feet ahead of the others, and as he walked he swinged his arms to the sides, warming up. The other two dragged heavy-looking burlap bags behind them.

 His head was yanked back, and he could smell the rancid breath of a gangster inches away from his face. He couldn't help but whince at the stench, a mix of cabbages and stale meat. He forced back the nausea and managed to stare into the bloodshot eyes. 

 - Not even a whimper. Good. I'll enjoy breaking you that much more.

 Her head spun from the blow, and blue spots danced in her eyes when she opened them, but she forced herself to keep them open and tried to focus her blurry eyesight on the mobster coming towards her, menacingly swinging the golf club. 

 - Wha's the matter, lil' girl? Can't cut it in the big boy leagues? Well how 'bout we set you up with a dis'bility handicap, eh? 

 She saw the club rise and tried to turn to air but she could not focus through the haze, and when it came down all she could do was force herself not to cry out. Pain flowed like white-hot liquid fire up her leg and into her head, burning away at her already thin grip of consciousness. 

 The world slowed down around her. She could still see the mobster in front of her, and see his lips move, but could no longer hear his taunts. Like a film in slow motion, she saw him raise the club once more and bring it down on her, but it really was like watching a film. It was not happening to her. She turned her head to look at Owain were he had been lying, still heavily drugged and bound to the beam. To her surprise she saw that he was now awake and had stood up, and now was straining desperately against his bonds, his eyes bulging and his face a mask of rage and desperation. Stupid git, he was just going to make his injuries that much worse. The cut in his forehead was still bleeding, the purple blood giving him a ghastly look. His mouth was open... was he shouting? She could not hear anything, only the deafening silence registered. And there were the other mobsters, too, the ones guarding Owain and who were now laughing openly at his anguish, handguns ready at their sides. Something moved in the periphery of her vision, and she turned back in time to see the club being raised once more, and knew that when it came down it would be the last time, and the darkness would finally take her. 

 She looked up, and stared at her attacker's eyes. She would not show fear. A memory of a line from a book she'd once read came to her mind, of all things. Something about living her second life as she looked at death in the face. Who was that from? It seemed appropriate, though. The club was now at the top of its trajectory, and the mobster's eyes gleamed with sadistic pleasure as he looked down on her. Still she held her gaze, defiant. 

 It was then that the mobster broke eye contact, turned to his right, and then slowly looked up. In an instant, his face went from surprise, to shock, to absolute terror. In her dreamlike state, she too turned to her left. The first thing she noticed was that Owain was no longer bound to the beam. He was also no longer in his real form, he'd finally managed to change and had grown and now the slavering jaws of a silvery white dragon were coming down on her attacker. The guards were shooting at him, but the bullets bounced off the scales that covered him and he ignored them, and biting down on her would-be murderer's head, he lifted him off his feet, and grabbing the legs with taloned claws he tore the mobster in three.

Whichever president came before Hafez (i just new he was president before assad) has considerable foreground of support, in which his supports would have freaked out because of the coup. They would have claimed instability would arise, as assad's supporters are trying to use in their defense. 

What i am trying to say is that although Bashar assad had good economic and international policies for Syria, you should not fear a non-baathist potentially being elected.  Syria's economic and international policies won't change (iran would still be a major factor in Syrian life considering the buisness deals stakes and cultural exchanges) , the only this that would change are social freedoms, and for the better. Also every country had a revolution and they are still alive today. The Muslim brotherhood in Syria is weak, even weaker than the islamist prescence in Libya. The rebels in Libya had 80-90% support, as we see now, and yet could hardly take control without NATO. What chance does the Syrian Muslim brotherhood have? None. If anything, nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the Muslim brotherhood, making them less of an influence in the everyday life of Syrians. As you know I am pro Syria and Armenia, just not pro Assad. Unlike Armenia where people like Sargsyan and Kopcharyan were democratically elected, Assad was not (no one ran against him because they were not allowed)."

Not even one non-Western source is cited among the 340 odd sources cited ....  :::: On my bookshelf right here beside me are no less that seven English language non-Western histories of WW2, some of them by Soviet historians. So there's no question about the existence of English language non-Western histories. These are considered reliable and established lines of research in their respective non-Western countries of origin, just as the Western sources cited in the article are considered to be reliable and from established lines of research in the West. Therefore both Western and non-Western positions should be reflected in the article, if it is to claim that it's NPOV, which it is not. Forget about all the efforts to discredit me, some of which are perfectly valid. Just address the issue at hand, namely POV bias through omission as repeatedly alleged by me, and which has resulted in a lot of displacement activity that seeks to evade the central issue of NPOV. Even or especially the intervening administrator has managed to evade the issue. The unsigned editor in this section admits that he has reliable access to history library resources so, if he has the time and inclination, maybe HE can come up with some reliable non-Western sources in the interests of NPOV, which everyone claims I'm contravening (among other things).   `"

I know Tila does mostly softcore work, but if you search around you will see she appears in films caressing other women in the nude and in a very explicitly sexual manner that is intended to arouse the viewer.  I think she at least qualifies as an erotic actress, even if not completely a porn star.     == Cuyamaca ==  I noticed that you added the merge tag to Cuyamaca and Cuyamaca, California. I originally created a single article but it seemed to me that towns and villages tend to have dedicated articles so I split the article in two. I'm inclined to agree that a single article would be sufficient. Is this consistent with other articles that cover a city, town or village and the like-named region in which they sit? If so, in your opinion, should the articles be consolidated under ``Cuyamaca`` or ``Cuyamaca, California``?    I couldn't find enough information about the village to expand it so I merged Cuyamaca with Cuyamaca, California and marked Cuyamaca for deletion. I assume that all the other particulars, such as the duplicate article page, will be taken care of.      thanks for the edits of my pages, I'm often vague and I forget formatting. ps how do you do that neat thing where you make you name ant the time you commented appear after posting a ``talk`` thing? -maximusnukeage  ==Re: Models Wikiproject== That sounds like a good idea.

By convention, the entries in the leftmost column are only wikilinked once there is a railway station article for the town/city/locale. Your links go to what are, in the context of a list of UK railway stations, random pages ( best wishes  I've created a  basic article for Jewellery Quarter station and inserted a link for just that station.    == Northern vs. Southern California speech ==  In response to your question on the Regional American English talk page, I think it would be fascinating to see a section on differences between Northern and Southern California speech, especially since both regions seem to have distinct characters. Of course, it would be helpful if you could provide other examples, but the one you cited would be a good start, too.    ==Culture of Greece==  Culture of Greece is this week's Collaboration of the week.  Please come and help it become a featured-standard article.  == Confirmation ==  Jeff, are you sure that her surname is Lee? In the English context, evidence is provided that she is Lee, Sung Hi or Sung Hi-Lee, which says that Sung is her surname. However, using Hangul or Hanja/Hanzi to search, her surname is Lee. You may be correct, but try searching using these methods that I stated. Thanks,   ==Tila Nguyen== She was in the movie 2 Fast 2 Furious.   == Re: Current Events, death of Iris Chang ==  I put the mention of her death back into the current events section that you removed.  Yes, there is a list of deaths on the right, but it does not contain links to outside news articles.  Also note that Yasser Arafat's death is listed in the main section of the page even though he is listed in the deaths section.  If you have any comments/questions please reply to my talk page.     : I removed the notice of her death, and not Arafat's, because Arafat was a major politician who played an enormous role in his part of the world, and Ms. Chang is a (noted) pop-historian.

There are only two ways to write months: long form, and short form.
Long form: Months мај, јун, јул, maj, jun, jul + јуни, јули, juni, juli (besides other 9+9 i.e. 18 ones) all belong in long_months. That’s resolved.
Short form: short_months must all have dot (they’re all the dotted short names) except famous 6 (or 10 if you count јуни, јули, juni, juli which are variants for јун, јул, jun, jul, respectively). We don’t use """"мај."""", """"јун."""", """"јул."""", """"maj."""", """"jun."""", """"jul."""" because there are already existing long forms in that shape (""""мај"""", """"јун"""", """"јул"""", """"maj"""", """"jun"""", """"jul""""), and if we abbreviate """"јуни"""", """"јули"""", """"juni"""", """"juli"""" as """"јун."""", """"јул."""", """"jun."""", """"jul."""" we did it illegally because there are already """"јун"""", """"јул"""", """"jun"""", """"jul"""" as long forms that cannot be abbreviated (and are used in Serbian much much more often than јуни, јули, juni, juli).
So, yes: dot is ALWAYS required for short month names except for my famous 6 with extra 4 mentioned above (famous 10 in total).

What you’have presumed is almost 100% correct, and code above should be actually 100% correct. Taking into account my two definitions above for long form and short form it’s like this, I suppose:
 long names of varying lengths; not shortened versions
local long_months = {['јануар']=1, ['фебруар']=2, ['март']=3, ['април']=4, ['мај']=5, ['јун']=6, ['јуни']=6, ['јул']=7, ['јули']=7, ['август']=8, ['септембар']=9, ['октобар']=10, ['новембар']=11, ['децембар']=12, ['januar']=1, ['februar']=2, ['mart']=3, ['april']=4, ['maj']=5, ['jun']=6, ['juni']=6, ['jul']=7, ['juli']=7, ['avgust']=8, ['septembar']=9, ['oktobar']=10, ['novembar']=11, ['decembar']=12};

 short names all three characters; these do not use terminal period
local short_months = {['мај']=5, ['јун']=6, ['јул']=7, ['maj']=5, ['jun']=6, ['jul']=7};

 short names all three characters; these require terminal period
local dot_months = {['јан']=1, ['феб']=2, ['мар']=3, ['апр']=4, ['авг']=8, ['сеп']=9, ['окт']=10, ['нов']=11, ['дец']=12, ['jan']=1, ['feb']=2, ['mar']=3, ['apr']=4, ['avg']=8, ['sep']=9, ['okt']=10, ['nov']=11, ['dec']=12};

Only changes are extra , ['јун']=6 and , ['јул']=7 for local long_months, and is_valid_month_range_style() should do the job perfectly.

It can be equaled to December–June 2014 which might be December 2013 – June 2014 or December 2014 – June 2015. Winter–Spring 2014 is still ambiguos in my opinion, and dates for solstices and eqinoxes don’t change that by  values they have at the moment (which are going to change in the very far future because Earth does not travel along the same path every year; it changes for sure but for 10–I don’t know really meters). At that time, we won’t be on modules I hope.    04:54, 11"""

Let me help you to be just for one day unbiased:  * It is true that there are ``fringe`` elements that do not believe in evolution. * However, someone who did not believe in evolution would have a very difficult time getting into graduate school in biology in any respectable accredited school anyplace in the world. * Aside from a few religious fundamentalists who somehow feel that evolution challenges their beliefs... * The antievolutionists are in the same camp as people who believe in extraterrestrials abducting people or cows, or in the Loch Ness Monster, or ghosts, or vampires, or avoiding black cats, or any number of other unfounded beliefs that people adopt. * ...and nonbelievers in evolution * Should an article on NASA have a big section on UFOs and UFO abduction of farm animals? * Why would you think otherwise? * Among those with advanced training, I would expect this number to be far higher.  I am not going to carry on with this list. If this is the way to go about and insult/attack people in this ambiguous, indirect manner, I'd be glad to change to that way. It would be fun to attack people personally by implying things between the lines, like your buddy did (which you didn't warn). I am a very uncivil and aggressive person, so it would be fun to find alternative ways to personally attack those who do not directly insult me or my culture. Actually, I don't give a crap what you people at Wikipedia think. You're all a bunch of evolutionistic mythologists who are trying to force your lame hypotheses down the throats of those who still have the brain capacity to believe the more sensible alternative theories.

0,"  My 2 cents ... I agree that this was a minor event in RuneScape history.  It is already being forgotten by all but those who want to sensationalise it into something it is notm i.e. significant.  It is well covered in the construction article in the history section.  The video is not verified as authentic.  I've seen it, and it appears to be highly edited, which could drastically affect its authenticity.  Jagex has acknowledged and fixed the problem.  The coincidence that it happened on a specific date is just that, coincidence.  No one but the vandals who keep changing the article calls it the 666 massacre.  That's just silly.  Get over it and let it go.  It is not significant to RuneScape or to anyone over the age of 14.   "

The introduction, for example , is one of the worst I've read on Wikipedia and it gives absolutely no indication of who this person is and what kind of controversy surrounds him.

 Mughals 

Claiming that the Mughals were a Turkic people, and mentioning some odd Turkish name given to them (a name that does not appear in ANY historical or scholarly sources), is pure POV. 

The Mughals were neither Turks in ethnicity (they were originally Mongols, descening from the Timurid and other Chingizid families of Central Asia > Berlas Mongols), nor in language (starting with Humayun, they were certainly and evidently Persian-speakers; Akbar did not even know Chaghatay - he had to translate his grandfather's memos into Persian to read them! Later, the Mughals were evidently Urdu speaking!)

I do not know why certain users keep putting that POV paragraph into the article. They claim that it is sourced ... but not all sources are good. Why do they ignore the whole bunch of other, mostly authoritative sources (such as the works of Prof. B.F. Manz, THE leading expert on Timurid and Turco-Mongol history; see: B.F. Manz, """"Tīmūr Lang"""", in Encyclopaedia of Islam, Online Edition, 2006)?! They only stick to certain versions of the Britannica ... only those that suite them. They totally ignore other sections of Britannica that actually have a totally different opinion on the isse. For example this one:

""""... Baber: The first Mughal, or Mongol, emperor of India (1526–30) and founder of the Mughal Dynasty there was Baber. He also won distinction as a military commander, a gifted poet and diarist, a statesman, and an adventurer. As ruler of the principality of Fergana in Turkestan, his birthplace, Baber first tried to recover Samarkand, the former capital of the empire founded by his Mongol ancestor Timur Lang ..."""" 

The Columbia Encyclopaedia states:

''""""... Timur (timoor') or Tamerlane (tăm'urlān), c.1336–1405, Mongol conqueror, b. Kesh, near Samarkand. ..."""" 

The paragraph about the Mughals should be removed. Even IF some people believe that they should be listed, only because their FIRST ruler (Babur) wrote his memoires in Turkic, the paragraph should be removed because it's controversial. Memoires do not prove anything, especially in regard of the fact that Humayun's biography is written in Persian (by his sister Gulbadan Begum), and that Shah Bahadur II is known as one of the greatest Urdu poets! 

In no way the Mughals were a """"Turkic people"""" ... neither in origin, nor in ethnicity, culture, language, or influence.  """

 Acting or Under Secretary of State? 

Cordell Hull was Secretary of State from 1933 to 1944, Sumner Welles was Under Secretary of State from 1937 to 1943.  In 1940 Cordell Hull was Secretary of State (nominated, confirmed and sworn in).

0,"== Please stop this! == 

 Petergans, please stop this revert war. Wikipedia is a collaborative project, and you must learn to respect the work of other editors. You have been told more than once in the past that nobody owns an article, and yet you insist on overwriting anything not written by you. After your last rewrite, I left the historical section completely alone because I know nothing about that, instead confining my edits to the lead and the contemporary section. But you were still not satisfied. You insist on recreating the history section in the lead, without giving any context or introduction. Unfortunately, this is NOT in accordance with Wikipedia style conventions. Unless you can gather community consensus to change guidelines regarding article leads, I'm afraid your edits are not acceptable. 

 You also insist on packing the contemporary section with irrelevant information about equilibrium calculation, when clearly all modern references to the law of mass action treat it as a kinetic postulate. I understand that equilibrium thermodynamics is your specialisation, but that does not mean you have to put in your knowledge where it does not belong. I think this has gone on long enough. If rewriting articles completely with no regard for other people's work is the only way you can edit, then I'm afraid Wikipedia is not the right place for you. Perhaps you will feel more at home writing a traditional encyclopedia. I understand that as an expert it may be frustrating to see your work edited by people with no traditional qualification, but that's the way Wikipedia works. You can take it or leave it, but edit warring will not change anything. Edit responsibly and we can reach a satisfactory conclusion."

Jake is irritated at being picked up by his brother Elwood in a battered former Mt. Prospect, Illinois police car, instead of the Cadillac The Blues Brothers used to own. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Blues Brothers visit their childhood home, a Roman Catholic orphanage, Saint Helen-of-the-Blessed-Shroud Orphanage. From Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman), The Blues Brothers learn that a property tax lien on the orphanage property will be foreclosed upon unless five thousand dollars in property taxes is remitted on its behalf to the county (the associated church has elected instead to sell the building to the Board of Education rather than pay the tax assessment). At the advice of their childhood mentor, Curtis (Cab Calloway), The Blues Brothers attend an evangelical church service at Triple Rock Baptist Church, led by the Reverend Cleophus James (James Brown), where Jake has an epiphany: The Blues Brothers can legitimately raise the funds by re-forming their rhythm and blues band, The Blues Brothers’ Band.NEWLINE_TOKEN  NEWLINE_TOKENAs The Blues Brothers drive past a doughnut shop and Nelson Funeral Home in the Bluesmobile, Elwood’s driving alerts two Illinois State Police troopers, Trooper Daniel (Armand Cerami) and Trooper Mount (Steven Williams), who, after pursuing The Blues Brothers into a quiet, secluded residential area, learn from their in-car SCMODS (State-County-Municipal Offender Data System) computer terminal of Elwood’s suspended driver's license. When Trooper Daniel and Trooper Mount attempt to place Elwood under arrest, Elwood speeds off, escaping by driving and crashing through, with the Illinois State Troopers in pursuit, the Dixie Square Mall. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAfter parking the Bluesmobile in an alley-end compartment next to a high-voltage transformer (hence the Bluesmobile’s remarkable magical abilities) and arriving at Elwood’s home, a hotel for transients, The Blues Brothers are mysteriously unharmed from a bazooka attack launched by a mystery woman (Carrie Fisher). The next morning, just as the Illinois State Troopers who attempted to arrest Elwood the previous evening, with the help of Parole officer Burton Mercer (John Candy) as to the true address of “the elegant abode of one Elwood Blues” (because Elwood had ‘falsified his renewal’ and ‘put down ten sixty West Addison’, the street address of Wrigley Field) attempt to serve an arrest warrant at Elwood’s tiny room, the mystery woman detonates a bomb that demolishes the building, which inadvertently saves The Blue Brothers from another attempted arrest.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENElwood proceeds to his “straight job”, on the assembly line at an aerosol-can manufacturer, takes several cans from the line and places them in his briefcase, and visits the plant manager, quitting his job, citing a decision to become a priest (curiously, Elwood’s supervisor’s office is adorned with a U.S. flag and an Illinois state flag, suggesting that the aerosol-can manufacturer in an enterprise owned by the government of the State of Illinois—or else simply that Elwood’s supervisor thought it would be cool to adorn his office with a U.S. flag and an Illinois flag).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJake and Elwood begin tracking down members of the band. Trombonist Tom “Bones” Malone and the rhythm section of the group (Willie “Too Big” Hall, Steve “The Colonel” Cropper, Donald “Duck” Dunn, and Murphy “Murph” Dunné) known as “Murph and the Magictones”, are playing in an empty Holiday Inn lounge, “The Armada Room”, and are readily convinced to rejoin The Blues Brothers’ Band. Trumpeter “Mister Fabulous” (Alan Rubin), now maître d' at a restaurant, is more of a challenge to persuade (“you ain′t never gonna get ’em outta those high-payin’ gigs”), but Jake and Elwood rudely convince him with some dining-room hijinks. En route to meet saxophonist Louis “Blue Lou” Marini and guitarist Matt “Guitar” Murphy, The Blues Brothers drive through a rally of neo-Nazis (upon whom Jake comments “Illinois Nazis—I hate Illinois Nazis!”) and adding another enemy to the The Blues Brothers’ growing list of pursuing parties. Marini and Murphy are working at the soul food restaurant on Maxwell Street, in Calumet City, Illinois, which Murphy owns with his wife (Aretha Franklin). Against her advice, the two musicians leave and rejoin the band. The reunited group obtain new musical instruments and associated equipment from Ray (Ray Charles) of Ray’s Music Exchange, in Calumet City, Illinois, on loan, pending payment from the proceeds of The Blues Brothers’s Band’s pending ‘triumphant return’.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJake is unable to book a gig in advance, a"

NPOV
I believe the following assertion belies a non-neutral point of view: """"Two feminist historians, Elizabeth Mason-Hohl and Kate Campbell Hurd-Mead, wrote about Trotula in the 1930s/40s. Both women made false and unsupported elaborations about Trotula’s life, leading to misconceptions that last to this day."""" To call Mason-Hohl and Hurd-Mead's claims """"false and elaborate"""" is groundless, especially given that Hurd-Mead's text is still today one of the most reliable sources for the study of the History of Science. Moreover, primary source evidence exists to prove that women graduated from the School of Salerno.

0,"Redistributional Effects of Monetary Policy

Inflation targeting is not a neutral pareto improvement.  Any choice of target
redistributes from some groups to others - making some worse off.
For example, high inflation harms holders of fixed rate debt - including
pensioneers, holders of fixed income securities, employees with protected
jobs and annuity-like compensation (including most government employees,
and policy makers, and most tenured academics), and creditors.  It benefits
net debtors - particularly if they have fixed rate debt or debt with interest
rate caps.  It also benefits owners of commodities, real estate, foreign currencies,
equity in export oriented firms, local employees in trade sensitive and
offshoring-capable sectors, and the unemployed.  Low inflation benefits
holders of fixed rate debt, business that export to the target country,
importers, employees who gain from offshoring, retired people on fixed pensions
and people with protected annuity like wages (academics, government employees,
and policy makers).  Low inflation therefore tends to favor rentiers -
increasing their wealth by boosting the purchasing power of their assets,
and transfers wealth away from debtors, owners of real estate,
owners of commodities, local import sensitive businesses, and the insecurely employed.

In theory, this could be corrected - restoring its neutrality (and Pareto improvement),
however transaction costs, moral hazard, information asymmetry and political 
resistance would make such wealth transfers grossly impractical.

To the extent that Monetary policy creates a known and predictable transfer
of wealth between a priori known counterparties, it is not a neutral economic tool 
and cannot be divorced from political considerations and preferred constituencies.

Furthermore, such constituencies will try to influence choice of monetary policy
targets - rentiers/creditors and pensioners will prefer tight monetary policy, 
debtors will prefer looser monetary policy, as will exporters and other participants
in (internationally)tradeable sectors of the economy, owners of commodities  
and real estate, and the precariously employed

If redistribution of wealth via such mechanisms has differential efficiency
impact and impacts the network of business formation and production within
and between trading nations, some monetary policy targets may also move
an economy away from an efficient frontier.

Moral Hazard of Monetary Policy Making Agents 

From a principal agent perspective, monetary policy makers face 
a personal moral hazard - since their compensation typically takes the
form of a secure fixed annuity.  This would incentivize them to favor
tight monetary policy - even at the expense of lower real GDP growth.
Compensation schemes that made their personal wealth inversely related
to the unemployment rate would create a moral hazard in favor of overly
loose monetary policy.  Compensation schemes that made their personal wealth 
contingent on real GDP growth may be more efficient by reducing their
overall moral hazard."

0,"`::::::Well, that'll teach me.  I wrote a big long response, and it didn't show up.  I must have just looked at the preview and not made sure I actually saved it.  Anyway... ::::::Holy copy and paste, Batman!  Would someone mind pointing out to me where in my previous post I said anything about parenthetical disambiguation that would lead SPUI to believe I ``misunderstand`` it.  Unlike my previous posts, not once did I mention anything about parentheses or articles titled ``State Route 4 (Washington)``.  The purpose of my previous post was not to debate disambiguation methods, rather it was to show SPUI through reason (something I will continue to do, PHenry, fruitless or not) that people do call these roads ``Washington State Route XX`` and it is a valid, more complete name.  Perhaps SPUI's misunderstanding came from my statement: ``The question here is not what do people inside a certain state call their own state route.  Wikipedia is for a global audience.  In titling our articles, we have the unique task of figuring out what to call a state highway without having defined the state first.``  I suppose I shall try to explain that further. ::::::Wikipedia is a global encyclopedia.  This means that we are not concerned with what the state of Washington calls their own state routes; we are concerned with what the globe calls them.  The official name does matter, particularly when determining whether to title the articles ``State Route`` or ``State Highway`` or ``State Road`` or something else entirely, but it does not end at the official name.  Let's take PHenry's Charles I example from our debate on Wikipedia talk:WikiProject California State Highways, and pretend for a moment with me that we're talking about living kings, although it truly doesn't matter.  A peasant in England would undoubtedly refer to his king as simply Charles I, just as a peasant in Spain would refer to his king as simply Charles I.  According to your logic, SPUI, we would title these articles Charles I (England) and Charles I (Spain), since that is what people in those countries call their own kings.  (Notice how I understand perfectly well what disambiguation means.)  But that's not what these articles are titled.  Why not?  Well, the English subject would refer to the Spanish king by the more complete name of Charles I of Spain, just as the Spanish subject would refer to the English king by the more complete name of Charles I of England, in order to disambiguate from their own kings.  Furthermore, someone from neutral Australia would refer to both kings by their more complete names to disambiguate them from each other, since if they said just ``Charles I``, it would not be clear which country they were talking about.  Here on Wikipedia, we use the global, more complete names. ::::::The global, more complete name for  is ``Washington State Route 4``.  The reason search results for phrases like ``washington state route`` are so much lower than washington ``state route`` is because people rarely have to refer to a state route without it already being clear what state they are talking about, but this exactly what one has to do when titling an article in a global encyclopedia.  There are still plenty of search results to show that it is a valid, more complete name.  I apologize for not linking to my search results in my previous post, but here are two I found particularly interesting: from the National Park Service and from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, two federal government agencies. ::::::Did you notice how Travisl said ``WA SR-XX`` at the end of his post?  Short for Washington State Route? ::::::I noticed how you still have conveniently failed to answer my question.  What would you call ? ::::::As proof that I do understand disambiguation, let me explain it to you.  WP:D outlines a variety of different methods for disambiguation.  Parenthetical disambiguation in the form of A (B) does, in fact, refer to a topic whose proper name is A, and is used when there is another topic called A that as PHenry explained (also on the WP:CASH talk page) has equal right to the name A, and would be disambiguated with the form A (C).  Another way of stating this ``equal right`` theory is that when a user types A into the search box, there's a fairly equal chance they would be searching for A (B) or A (C), and further, when a user is searching for A (B) or A (C) they would be likely to type A into the search box.  But keep in mind that parentheses are not the only way to disambiguate according to WP:D.  WP:D also outlines the more complete names method, and clearly states that it should be used "
0,"   :Why would having embassies and international relations make annexation and statehood shocking?  The Republic of Hawaii, which replaced the Kingdom of Hawaii, had international relations and embassies.  As a weary veteran of POV wars regarding the pro-sovereignty POV, I have to say I'm very skeptical that adding citations of international recognition for the various governments that have ruled over the Hawaiian islands doesn't add very much to the article.  I would suggest that if you would like to introduce your citations back into the article, that in order to avoid the cherry-picking of history you mention, please also include citations that the Republic of Hawaii was universally internationally recognized, and the annexation of Hawaii was universally internationally recognized.  Only highlighting the international recognition of the Hawaiian Kingdom seems to be POV pushing if the other governments of Hawaii are not accorded the same detail, don't you think?  :Insofar as improbable roads, did you realize that after the Paulet affair, Kamehameha III negotiated a treaty of annexation with the U.S., which was only thwarted by his untimely death?

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you for saying what needed to be said to me, but in a very respectful, sophisticated manner. I've taken the time to review both articles you referenced, especially personal attacks. While what I said was not directed at any specific person, it was in direct conflict with a portion of what constitutes a personal attack. For that, I'd like to apologize. The reason I verbally came out swinging, so to speak, is because of misdirected frustration. There is an individual with whom I had a conflict regarding the episode page of another show, a show about which I'm almost as passionate as I am about Person of Interest, and that very same person if one of those who reverted my edit (mind you, for good reason I now know), however, when this took place on another TV show's page, he was extremely passive aggressive and hostile in his immediate discrediting of my editing abilities. I had just started using Wikipedia at the time and was not very proficient in computational cyber protocol, or even writing code (that is not the case anymore) Please do not misinterpret this, as I know I am the one in the wrong, and I am not trying to engage in a dialogue in which I somehow look like the victim. I just feel as though I needed to explain myself, and who better with whom to do so than the one of 4 users on Wikipedia who have shown me respect and made me feel welcome.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am well aware that the world will not end if the POI Season 5 info is not complete (lol). If I thought the world were to end, I wouldn't be on my computer. But passive aggression aside, I sincerely am a person who loves Person of Interest and Criminal Minds, as they have helped me deal with deep-seeded problems in my own life, as far-fetched as that may sound, so I make it my business to do the best I can to help keep fellow fans as informed as possible, and Wikipedia is an amazing vessel through which to do so. In my mind, I saw how many little error notices Wikipedia has put on the POI episode lists and wondered why my mistake was IMMEDIATELY centered out, but whoever made the mistakes of adding too long of an episode summary, over 40 times, was not reprimanded. However, it is foolish to assume they weren't. I reacted much in disproportion to the situation, and I do not intend to do so again, as I want to respect Wikipedia's rules. I just felt that a specific user had discredited my information for the sole purpose of undermining me. That did, in fact, happen on a page for Criminal Minds and I was the aggrieved party in that case. My information was solid, came straight from a co-executive producer, and yet this person continued reverting it, so I sought help and reported him. However, to think that same scenario applies to this POI conflict... I now see how slanted and nonsensical that is.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn conclusion, I will not add information unless it can be traced back to an original source, credible and solid. (like my addition of Fred Toye as director and Andy Callahan as co-writer of POI episode 5-10 - the 100th) I do apologize if I've offended you with my two aggressive edit summaries, as they were the result of misdirected anger and frustration. Thank you for informing me of where I went wrong, and remaining respectful and composed. I love to learn, and I'm glad I've learned more specific information about how to avoid reference/edit info-conflicts. I also want you to know that I'm well aware that Wikipedia is not a fan site. While I intend to show you the utmost respect, that was uncalled for. I can read - very well, in fact. Je peux parler en Français aussi, et je peux le comprendre. I know that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, that is why I try to be as thorough as possible, and if this sentence comes off as condescending, that is because you offended me as well. I did not insult you, or anyone specifically; what I did was make a childish, anger-driven, juvenile comparison of whoever reverted my edits to royalty, or self-appointed leaders. It was a mistake to do so, and since I'm not very good at conflict resolution - the fact that this is my best attempt to mend fences proves that - I'm going to stop now because I'm starting to argue with my own intentions. Please forgive my outburst, and be assured that it won't happen again. I will continue to help build a stronger Season 5 episode table with solid references, but I fully intend to adhere to the rules and keep my opinions of other editors to myself.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThank you for helping me to stay informed, so that I can continue to inform fellow TV Crime Drama fans.

I like that you were able to make use of some of the information we covered in class specifically related to this topic, but were also able to include plenty of outside resources.  Many of the concerns I had have been addressed in prior comments, but there is one section that I find slightly unclear.  It may just be the way I am reading your wording, but I figure there is always a chance that someone else will take it the same way and have the same question I do...  In the toxicology studies section, I think your intention is to say that because the mouse study used very high doses of the protein and proteins that will be toxic are usually toxic at very low doses, evidence supports that the Bt toxin is not toxic to mammals.   what I initially read, however, was just the phrase ``Research on other known toxic proteins suggests that proteins are usually toxic at low doses, further suggesting that Bt toxins are not toxic to mammals`` which confused me by making it sound like the toxins are almost always toxic at low doses and that the Bt toxin might not be safe.  Perhaps changing this wording would help clarify your meaning for future readers?  Just a thought.  Overall, great job!   `"

The problem is the wider we cast the net in terms of subject matter for the article, the more room there is for disagreement and debate.  Energies are dispersed, and the article becomes lopsided and uneven.  Read the article on Human skin color.  This article discusses the various theories about human skin color.  One scenario is that fair skin is the result of spontaneous, random mutation, that, theoretically, there were white-skinned people (the result of genetic mutations) in Africa, but they simply did not survive to produce progeny; that the same mutations occurred when humans migrated north, but because of the climate, those mutants survived to bear and rear offspring.  Another scenario posits that humans initially were pale like simians, but as they began to lose their hair, their skin darkened over time as a climatic accommodation.  And there are other theories, as well.  You want to get into melanin in this article  and the accompanying sturm und drang of agrument, disagreement and, potentially, more edit warring (just look at what's happened here with a far narrower piece)  and for material that eventually will be cut out, anyway?

A letter written around AD 96 on behalf of the Roman church to the Christians at Corinth speaks of Peter and Paul as 'our Apostles', suffering witnesses of the truth who, 'having born testimony before the rulers', went to glory.  Writing to the Roman Christians about the year 107, Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, declared that 'I do not command you, as Peter and Paul did', a clear indication that he believed that the Apostles had been leaders of the Roman church.``     And this is the most significant statement that sums up the author of Saints and Sinners musings on all of this evidence on page 9 ``There is no sure way to settle on a date by which the office of ruling bishop had emerged in Rome, and so to name the first Pope, but the process was certainly complete by the time of Anicetus in the mid 150's, when Polycarp, the aged Bishop of Smyrna, visted Rome, and he and Anicetus debated amicably the question of the date of Easter.``    So my question is this: If the National Geographic puts the founding of the Church at the consecration of Peter as first bishop of Rome ``their words`` and this author of Saints and Sinners says ``There is no sure way to settle on a date... but it was certainly complete by the mid 150's``  then no person in the world is going to come up with a deliberate date without some sort of POV introduced here.  The only non-POV way to address the foundation and date of Roman Catholic Church is to do exactly what we have done ``Traditionally Jesus`` and ``Traditionally the year 30``.

On Sunday, the Big Red Machine will defend the title in a Triple Threat Match against Big Show and Mark Henry. While the World's Largest Athlete remains on SmackDown, the World's Strongest Man was pulled to ECW in Wednesday's Supplemental Draft, and is that brand's chance to bring the title back to the Land of the Extreme. But, if Triple H, Edge and Big Show have an extremely good Night of Champions, SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero could conceivably find her brand the home of all three World Championships, with both Raw and ECW left out in the cold.""""
Morrison's reign (Fast Forward to 3:30) """"These accolades are only fitting of a true champion, and I have an accolade that very few people in sports entertainment can claim. I am a World Champion. I am the new face of ECW. I am the ECW World Heavyweight Champion.""""
Henry's reign (Fast Forward to 0:25) 'There is a lot of talent in the ECW locker room, but I am a twelve-year veteran. This is my first World Heavyweight Title and I'll tell you one thing, it's going take a more powerful man than I am to take this title out of my hands.""""Hardy's reign """"The greatest achievement, however, came in 2008 when Matt triumphed in a Championship Scramble Match to capture the ECW Title; his first taste of World Championship gold.""""Hardy's reign continued """"After the contest was unscrambled and the winner was clear, Matt Hardy stood victorious as the new ECW Champion in the opening Scramble Match at Unforgiven... After a passion-driven, career-long hunt to possess a World Title, the deliverer of the Twist of Fate has found himself atop the mountain in the Land of the Extreme.""""Christian's reign """"Christian’s first World Title comes after a journey that expands well beyond his two months in the Land of the Extreme. """"Christian's reign continued (Fast Forward to 0:55) """"This is the first of three World's Championship matches here at SummerSlam as Captain Charisma electrifies the Staples Center here at SummerSlam.""""Christian's reign continued (Fast Forward to 2:15) """"Josh, to illustrate the global impact of this contest, if William Regal wins the ECW Championship he'll become the ninth non-US born superstar to capture a World Title' in the last 15 years. The WWE has certainly gone global and who better to wear the crown than William Regal""""
Once again, WWE recognized the ECW title to be a world heavyweight championship throughout its existence until the discontinuation of the brand, which resulted in all references pertaining to ECW being removed from WWE programming soon thereafter.

  The BLPN thread begins with this from you
After reverting an addition of a name of a living person to this article based on doubtful reasoning and subsequently the name being re-added, I am concerned about the basis of the whole article. There is an assumption that someone who is alleged to have had sex with a """"novice"""" or """"student"""" or """"disciple"""" (without unambiguous definitions of these terms) is fair game to be listed in this article as a """"sex abuse case"""". Some of the names listed have had no legal proceedings taken against them, others have been reported as having reached out of court settlements without the case being proven. There are obvious issues with the name of the article, the selection criteria for names being added and confusion about how well such cases need to be sourced. Fæ (talk) 
 However you spin it, it was you who initiated this process and you did not extend me the courtesy of informing me. I did not revert any deletion of yours in your account name unless it was an IP deletion or from another account and for each reversion I made I noted in the edit summary that I had referred to it  on the talk page and there gave my reasons and asked for dialogue.
 If I had seen your concerns I would have noted first of all that unambiguous definition of terms is not common in discourses and in any case I began the article with a clear description of what was meant by  'abuse' in the context of the article. Even in the drafting of legislation where great care is taken to be unambiguous there is nevertheless a need to leave some terms undefined: for example 'nation' in EU leglislation, 'indecent' in UK criminal legislation (in the context of child protection) - the examples are legion. In any case it is perfectly well understood what abusive sexual behaviour amounts to and abusive behaviour need not be criminal. In particular teacher-student sexual relationships are universally regarded as abusive on the part of the teacher. The selection criteria was mentioned in the article - that the individuals involved had founded Buddhist groups at the forefront of the emerging Western Buddhist movement.

It may not read smoothly there, and may have more photos than necessary, but I put a cleanup tag there and certainly the minority of people who wanted this page to be able such contests can go there and clean it up to their liking.

I redirected this term to photo manipulation article, as it was more in line with what the term meant (though technically Adobe Photoshop would have made more sense, but we have to go with consensus I guess). It appears someone else just moved photo manipulation elsewhere, so that may have to get cleaned up later. 

But, bottomline here is that the Photoshopping article no longer exists, as it was clear from discussion that it never should have in the first place but that a few editors with misplaced motives ignored for a long time and edit warred across several articles over.

 Knowledge of Dipterocarpaceae  

Wow, I'm not even sure how to say that word. Have we recently crossed paths editing somewhere?   WikHead  

To be quite honest, I don't really know a lot about trees. I am however searching for a good central tree-related talk-page for you... somewhere where you might have a better chance of attracting other users with the knowledge you seek. If I can find a good link, I will most certainly post it here to your talk page. )   WikHead  

You're most certainly welcome! I'm guessing that the talk-page at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Forestry might be a really good place to find other users who can be of most help to you. I wish you the very best of luck with your updates. Have yourself a great day Curritocurrito, and happy editing! )   WikHead  

Hi Curritocurrito, thanks for your post at WikiProject Forestry. If you could elaborate a little more either there or at Talk:Dipterocarpaceae about what specific additions you might suggest for that article, that would be helpful. Thanks,   
Thanks for your reply. I suggest that you add your questions  """"why are they important? what habitat are they living? what animals eat their seeds? are they important economically? what minerals or grounds they need?""""  to the Talk:Dipterocarpaceae page. That will help others think about how they might contribute to that article.   
I don't get much time to edit Wikipedia pages, but am slowly trying to creat stubs for all the Dipterocarps and correct errors in existing stubs/article. If anyone is interested in editing these pages and needs access to primary sources - I have a reasonable collection of papers (mainly for SE Asia) and can send pdfs.
RE: the questions raised above
are they important economically? - they use to be the main timber export from SE Asia. I don't have figures for what % of the timber trade they account for now
what minerals or grounds they need?- variable - there is a high degree of habitat speacilsation. Some species only occur in Peatswamps, other in poor sand soils i.e. heath forests, others on rich clay soils.
what animals eat their seeds? - when they fruit, which varies from yearly in some of the Sri Lankan species to onces every x (2-16) years in some of the Borneo species - they are an important food source.

0,"== So the fact that a large minority of students are Jewish is significant, the fact that is was founded as a women's college is significant but the fact that it was founded as a Christian college is not? You can't be serious. == 

  
 Actually, Goucher College was founded by Rev. Goucher, not just as a Christian women's college but as a Christian women's seminary chartered by the state of Maryland. Why is it even considered significant that a large minority of students at this former purely Christian, purely female institution are Jewish? Was Goucher College converted into a Jewish institution? No. Does the presence of an active Hillel organization make it a Jewish institution? Hardly.  In fact I think it would be fair to conclude that the heritage of the majority of Goucher college's students is Christian. Is it not bad enough that the goyem are not made to feel welcome in the Hillel House dining area? 

 The entryway to the original structure, still in active use today, includes passages from the bible written in Latin, not surprising because this was not just a Christian institution but a Methodist-Episcopalian one which, like the Catholic church, commonly used Latin as part of its liturgy.  So the historical treatment of heritage of Goucher College, which bears the name of the man who actually founded Goucher with its use as a Christian college squarely in mind, is still supposed to be eradicated.  

 The plurality of University of California students are Asian. Does that make UC an Asian school? No. Goucher College is now non-sectarian, yet it is to be identified now as a Jewish institution? The only religion which Goucher has ever been officially affiliated with is the religion of the college as it was originally founded - Christian. That is the school's heritage and it cannot and should not be scoured away."

0," History  Long before white settlers entered the area, Mississippian Indians or more specifically Adena and Hopewell Indians inhabited the present day area of Fredericktown. Early settlers found three mounds and earthworks located on nearby hilltops.  While the Raliegh Mound and Stackhouse Mound and Works are preserved today, the third mound, located by what is presently the Baptist Church, was demolished.  These mounds were all visible from one another when there was no foliage or building obstruction.  Both preserved mounds were most likely ceremonial structures and they are oriented towards the Sun's movements.  When settlers arrived, all they found were these abandoned sites with few other traces of the people who lived there. There were a few scattered Native Americans that settled nearby along what was then the perifery of Indian Lands established by the Greenville Treaty Line.  The first white settler was John Kerr who in 1807 bought and platted the town and built a mill on the North Branch of the Kokosing River.  Growth was sluggish until the Sandusky, Mansfield, and Newark Railroad came through the village in 1853.  A grain elevator, a foundry, and other small trading businesses set up shop to establish Fredericktown more firmly as a business center than nearby crossroad settlements of Batemantown and Waterford.  Around World War II a small airplane panelling factory was built and later reverted to the furnature manufacturing.  In the last half of the 20th century, a few light manufacturing operations and the largest privately owned general construction contractor in Ohio, Kokosing Construction, have been established there."

We all wait with baited breath to see if Commons to Lords comes up to our standards. It'll be a blow if it doesn't but Mr Maun can always rely on you to help him out. After all in a couple of weeks it'll be all his work you've copied to replace the crap on your website. Regards from all in the Law department.  ==Review== Book of the Year Award 2010 Nominee FROM COMMONS TO LORD'S Volume 1 1700-1750  Ian Maun   From a statistical and historical perspective one of the most important books of 2009 was the first volume of Ian Maun's series on eighteenth century cricket. In fact, after delving into this rich assemblage of material, published in association with both the MCC and the ACS, it is probably true to say that this is the most important book of the past few decades. This claim is based on the fact that the author, who works at Exeter University, has meticulously unearthed many new details as well as hitherto unknown matches from the early 1700s.   This book draws heavily from newspapers, journals, letters and other documents housed in national and provincial collections, as well as other resources not generally available to, or used by, the majority of cricket historians, including history books, dictionaries, novels, plays and poems. Moreover, this is not a reworking of other writers contributions, as the author is not afraid to question previously published material or other works which have hitherto been accepted by historians as being chapter and verse on 18th century cricket. Indeed, this book includes more than 200 references to cricket which, until now, have never before been published whilst several errors and omissions have been carefully corrected and filled. One can only wonder at what further riches lie in the next three volumes of this series.   The work stemmed several years ago from the author’s desire to understand the relationship of the Hambledon Club’s exploits to the cricket which had preceded those illustrious days. What started out as a series of notes trying to disentangle what was fact and what was fiction has metamorphosed into a work which provides a sharper and more complete picture of the noble game than previously achieved by many previous authors as well as some of the great scholars of cricket history.  This period of tricorn hats, curved bats and two-stump wickets is vividly brought back to life by the year-by-year listing of references, supported by the accompanying notes and the series of beautifully reproduced images. As such, it is not a book which will be slavishly read time and again from cover to cover. Instead, it is a fantastic reference book with, as one would expect from someone with a strong academic background, a superb set of footnotes and bibliographical tools.   Indeed, in his accompanying notes, the publisher claims that this book “will assuredly become the premier recourse for anybody interested in early and 18th century cricket history.” I would unhesitatingly venture one step further and suggest that in years to come, the author’s name will be spoken of in the same breath as Haygarth, Waghorn or Buckley. High praise indeed, but so richly deserved.  review by Andrew Hignell"

0,""":::I was surprised to realise that you had filed a checkuser request about me several days ago. And a little disappointed that you did not inform me of this. I did not really understand why you mentioned in the request that I had left a comment for Jimmy Wales, as though this was evidence of some bad intent. And I would say that Mr Wales more than agreed """"to some extent."""" His intervention was quick, clear and decisive (about a matter that had been ongoing for many months, and about which I had been told by other editors that I was disruptive because I was putting arguments with no validity). And even though in his first comment on the matter he indicated that he was not convinced the matter was libelous, only that it was blatant original research, in his follow-up comments he made it clear he considered the matter non-notable, and that there was absolutely no justification for its inclusion. I can only hope that, whatever doubts you had, they are now allayed. As I have mentioned on other occasions, I have no connection to Mr Langan, am not a proponent of his ideas, am not a proponent of ID, and only know of Mr Langan through the media (particularly the Errol Morris program). I am actually surprised they allowed the request, given that no evidence of bad behaviour was given, but now that you have the results, I hope you feel better about my contributions.

UNPRODUCTIVE SUICIDE ATTEMPTS or why the word """"PRACTISED"""" is not the case of Lubitz's earlier actions. Very often people who intend to commit suicide have had many interrupted attempts to do it when """"suicidal impulse"""" is not strong enough to overcome """"natural fear"""" and """"resistance of rational thought"""". For example, people trying to commit suicide with a gun often put the weapon to their head and then they interrupt this action moments before they pull the trigger. Viewed from the side, those unsuccessful suicide attempts are like theatrical act but this is just an illusion because every such attempt has the potential to end tragically. In the case of Lubitz - in the situation in which he intended to carry out his suicide there are several circumstances that limit his freedom of choice to interrupt the suicidal attempt - such as """"returning of the Captain"""" or """"what you are doing in the cabin?!"""". These circumstances can force his unproductive suicide attempts to became productive one in any moment and he knows that after them he will have no choice to turn back. For this reason it is """"normal"""" he to do first timid attempts - which were unsuccessful in the first flight """"Duesseldorf to Barcelona"""" because time is not limited. On his return back """"Barcelona to Duesseldorf"""" the end destination is forcing him. As I said he has not """"PRACTISED"""" but was """"TRYING"""" to commit suicide or in other words - he had unproductive suicide attempt.  """

Looking at the definition of nationality on the wiki page, it opens with the line ``Nationality is the legal relationship between a person and a state``, which taken at face value would of course make Nicola Sturgeon's nationality British (just as it is the nationality of Ruth Davidson or Kezia Dugdale), with no possibility of it being Scottish since Scotland does not exist as an independent state, and being born in the UK prior to 1983 conferred British nationality (at least in the legal sense).   In previous (rather thinly commented) discussions around SNP politicians, however, the preferred definition has instead been how people see themselves or are assumed to see themselves based on party membership. Is this really a good definition? Particularly given that there is often no actual citation given for these people seeing themselves in terms of actual nationality as Scottish only?   When this was discussed in relation to Gerry Adams, the case for his Irish nationality rested on the fact that he has an Irish passport. Obviously in the case of Nicola Sturgeon no such passport exists. What's the real justification for giving her nationality exclusively as Scottish?   `"

For the first thing this article is a stub and should be labeled as such - it says hardly anything about the Targowica Confederation save for enumerating it's prominent members.

You gave a warning on Mahawiki's page but you didn't warn any of the Kannada editors. If you don't know, all four(?) of them, Sarvagnya, KNM, Naveenbm and Gnanapiti had questioned the verifiability of the reference Mahawiki had provided. But had anyone else questioned it ? Still, Mahawiki e-mailed the file to everyone, then he uploaded it. Tell me wasn't all this done in good faith. Then these guys ``trashed`` his citation. What were you doing then ? You should've warned them. Mahawiki had to provide an online link to the article, which he has now provided. I think these same rules should apply to them as well. I question the verifiablity of Suryanath Kamat. Even if Suryanath Kamat may be a good writer (which I know he is not), but is what Kannambadi filling pages with, the same thing from the book. Kannambadi may be filling something else. And references from a single book could be WP:NEO. What about that ? And another thing, the way you replied on Kannambadi's page reeked of bias and partisan attitude. Really, I was never so dissapointed on Wikipedia. You know, when Mahawiki used yo get dissapointed, I would always tell him to keep faith in Wikipedia's admins. And I always believed the admins would never be prejudiced.

You'd think the guy could take a better picture or scan, especially since the whole goal of posting it appears to be proving his name to people critical of his pseudonymity without any further doubt. Regardless, and to fit with conventions, it may still be appropriate to add a (born Philip John Eide) to this entry or a future entry for Xavier Von Erck.

Martin applauds unethical traitors in the bureaucracy illegally leaking untruths, partial truths, unverifiable allegations and other anti-Trump garbage to bring down the new president, force a real constitutional crisis, and spit in the eye of their oath and of the ordinary people to selfishly maintain their privileges and power.

He waxes enthusiastically over an increasingly hysterical, dishonest and despicable media for their Pravda and Izvestia like propaganda to demonize Trump  and ensure a one party state of self serving liberals.

It is only civilized to give time for people to find and add references (depends on the nature of the claim though). As for ``partial democratic``, I would say that for example letting opposing parities to run for election (as opposed to none) but making it unfair by keeping the mass-media in your control could be considered ``partial democratic`` (or calling miners to take care of the opposition, political influnce in the act of justice, and examples can continue) I don't think even the FSN members would claim that the democracy in Romania was perfect at the moment when they finished their mandate. It's like saying that somebody started to say half-truths after they lied continously: it's a partial truth, but is not truth, therefore we can't say ``they started to tell the truth``  same in this case, not everything they did was democratic, I would have a bad feeling to leave it to ``they implemented democratic reforms`` because that would really be a half-truth. The best thing would be to detail what kind of reforms they implemented and where they failed democracy, but the space is too limitated for such detail, that's why ``partial democratic`` has to do it for now (before it was ``seemingly democratic`` which was more POVish in my opinion).    `"

The article was deleted because it was advertising and promotion and was not shown to be notable enough for Wikipedia standards. This isn't a personal attack on your article, and I understand that it was created with the best of intentions to contribute to  Wikipedia. However, when a page gets speedy-deleted for those reasons, generally the problem is that the article isn't written in a very neutral manner and/or that not enough outside references can be cited to show that it is actually a page that should be on Wikipedia. For example, if you include a phrase in an article about a company saying it provides excellent customer service, that is not neutral and is considered advertisement. However, mentioning that the company has won three national awards for customer service and is featured in several prominent news sources (and providing citations to prove those awards) is neutral. If you have sources showing why that company is important, feel free to create articles on that subject. Better yet, you may want to try creating articles in the Sandbox, where you can write articles and improve them with the help of others before moving it into main article space. Thanks!   "

Please don't revert correct information as you did to Bath School disaster. The number in the article matches the reference cited plus the sentence says the number INCLUDES his wife.

Also, if you notice in the info box of the list of deaths, it numbers 45 and that is not including the killer who commmited suicide. So 44 is accurate ONLY in the section cited. The number 43 is wrong any way you put it. I know it was the deadliest.

0,"`  == Shmede ==    Shmede, also known as RW, Schememememede or Romeo Whiskey, is a very competitive chap, who tends to frequently cheat at snooker so he can brag to his fellow friends about how good he is at the sport. His most familiar way of doing this involves returning reds to the table that have already been potted. Another canny trick of his is adding more points than he should onto his score, whilst adding less than he should to opponents. He also has a tendency to say he hit a particular ball when it was obvious he did not. At times, Richard can also be mistaken for Nelson Mandela.  He regards himself as a rather specialist aggressive opening batsman when playing cricket, and together with his slow left arm ‘throws’, he is one whack tack and cack cricketer. Richard’s wicket taking ability is particularly admirable, though apart from claiming the wicket of Simon ‘The Don’ Yates, he generally gets creamed all over the park.  Other sports he attempts to play include football, where, over an illustrious playing career, he has inherited a number of enemies, none of which hate him as much as the Sun, as particularly in the summer months, he can be seen rather red as the Sun is attracted to him. Rumour has it, that this sunburn is the reason why his legs contain very little hair.  His attitude throughout all sports is hated by most, as he is accustomed to arguing with most of his fellow players, including ones on his own side!  RW quotes: *Shouts ‘J*ggaboo’ as loud as possible in Rileys *‘Ya scran head’ *‘Come back in 5 years’ *‘Get a haircut’ *'Doooooooooou like smack, doooooooooou like crack, then u will a love my new smack n a crack party bag. It has a smack and a plerrrrrrrrnty of crack. U can a steal ur friends car radio to pay for it'  *'R8 yunes' *'He's done him' *After hitting the wrong ball at snooker 'FOUL?! What you mean foul?! Dint you see I hit the red first, it was so obvious' *'Pre buzz', 'Rich has just sent a nudge', 'Buzz', 'Pre post buzz', 'Post buzz' *'Terina! Chips' *'Costootipoosmesh' *'I did dobin in 12 yesterday......first hole' *(When asked if the bat is knocked in) 'No its not tin' Then asked again... 'No its not tin, probably allumnium or something' *(When wearing velcro trainers) 'Hold this while I tie me shoe laces' *'Tight' followed closely by 'us bramble' *'Half the school fancies me!......just the wrong half'  In conclusion, Shmede can be simply summed up as a towel.  === Shmede and  at Rileys ===  Quite frequently, usually by RWs arrangement, a trip to Rileys is organised for a few frames of snooker featuring RW and RB. Originally set for one o'clock, the meet time at 'Brownie's corner' has recently been moved forward to avoid both parties waiting after lunch has been completed. The meet time at present is around 1220. RB often wears what RW describes as 'his lucky top' which features a dragon on the front. RW's lucky chain was removed after he lost nine frames in a row.  To alert RB of his imminent arrival, RW pranks him numerous times along his journey from his home to the corner. These pranks are located at the following points:  *When he sets off from his home, *At SPAR, where he picks up his, now accustomed, 'Spearmint Extra', *When he sees 'the corner', *Upon arrival to 'the corner'.  The journey down to Rileys is now via Hollis Lane as a maze has been erected on Horns Bridge Island. Upon arrival, RB picks the usual table 10, table 13 if 10 is not available, whilst RW visits the toilet and orders his Coke with one ice cube, the price of which is extortionate, and a tap water. The reasoning behind the one ice cube is that this is sufficient ice to cool the drink to an enjoyable temperature and yet not dilute the coke enough to affect its taste (noting that the room temperature of Rileys is at least a full three degrees above the standard 20-21 degrees and this hence means that should the generic four ice cubes be placed into the drink, they would melt at a particularly fast rate, diluting the cola even quicker).  Play usually consists of three frames, lasting approximately an hour and a half, although if RB wins the first two frames, RW is more than likely to concede. When play has been completed, RB will return the balls to the main desk, a job which RW cannot do as he is 'carrying his cue'.  On returning home, a visit to town often occurs, including a visit to Wilko, where RW will purchase one item of school stationery (returning for another item next time) and a drink, whilst RB will purchase a Boost and a drink also, if they are on offer.  If JB is present for this walk home, RB's phone is used for RW (aka Nelson Mandela) to talk to KO. This call, which can go on for at least ten minutes, is extremely humorous, and often sees  or TFO contributing at the other end.  A new variation to the Rileys experience is to travel by car. These trips are usually taken early afternoon when RW and RB finish school early, most likely on a Friday before cricket at the Cricketal! RW will drive down to the road outside the graveyard and park there before the final distance is done on foot. Usually, the trip involves some 'good driving' from RW, most likely in an attempt to avoid hitting other cars when parked on the hill. This is likely to be watched by builders who have blocked RW in with their mini JCB. In addition, RB will open the window but he can pay the extra petrol cost for the increased drag it causes. Because of the new mode of transport at RW and RB's disposal, there is a new ring system for time management. There are now only two points of prank and they are as follows:  *When Shmede gets in his car, *When Shmede is parked outside Ryan's (this one is bypassed should Ryan be wayTING outside).  Numerous more calls can be made if Shmede is parked outside the wrong house and Ryan hasn't come out because he thinks Shmede hasn't arrived. In this case Shmede can prank unlimited.  After Rileys, a ride round Winsick is now common, although more recently this has become somewhat infrequent due to the extortionate rise of petrol prices. This lasts for approximately ten minutes, depending on whether they get stuck behind a tractor. Upon completion of this short excursion, Brown Town is then dropped off at his abode, most likely in the same attire he wore the day before.  Ryan tends to not want Shmede to use his horn on 'Dicka' Suttle as he tends to chase him when he is in moving vehicles, usually because he 'needs his services'. If Ryan would just ring him back, then he would not need to run. Two oh six double oh one!  When parking, the duo can experience some troubles, usually due to Shmedes swish ability to leave his handbrake off. He usually realises, but not always. When walking away from the car, Shmede will usually ask 'I did put handbrake on dint I?' as well as 'I locked doors dint I?' More recently, upon parking Shmede is so worried about putting on the handbrake after his previous blunders that he does the following:    ==== Frequent quotes from Rileys: ====  RB: 'I'll ave a chew if there's one guin' RW: 'Yeh I bet u bloody will, god I've jst bught em cheeky git'  RB: 'Need to gu into tarn after?' RW: 'Aye remind me'  RB: 'Do ya need a rest JB?' JB: 'Nah I'm alr8 ta, I only jus started'  RB: 'Toooo thin!'  RB: 'Toooo thick!'  RB: 'Where am I guin, Rileys is that way!'  RB: (When talking about what Lyndsey has bought him for Valentine's Day) 'What do I want flowers for!'  RB: 'Look at that... that is wank'  RW: 'Toooo thin?' RB: 'Toooo shit!'  RB: (When Shmede nearly wins) 'I'm shattin me pants ere!'  RW: 'Need to go into town don't forget' RB: 'What for?' RW: 'Organic carrots'  RW: 'Wind's given me hair a rate tannin' RB: 'It dunt look any different...you look swish'  RW: 'Your hair looks different Ryan, have you done something diffferent?' RB: 'Not combed it'  RB: (When two nil down and is subsequently having the worst day of his life) 'That's not the pocket is it!'  ==== Results ====  {| | {| class=``wikitable`` style=``font-size: 85%`` |- valign=``top`` !valign=``middle``| Date !valign=``middle``|  !valign=``middle``|  !valign=``middle``| Winner !valign=``middle``| Minutes !valign=``middle``| Table Number |- ! 30 March 2007 |align=``center`` bgcolor=``#ffffbf``| |align=``center`` bgcolor=``#ffffbf``| |align=``center``| '''RB'"

 Not so!  Taft made an even bigger error. 

As was thoroughly discussed in the blawgosphere in the last 24 hours or so, there is likely no person anywhere with standing to challenge the oath as void, and in any case taking the oath is a condition precedent to executing the office; it is not actually important that it be done a particular way.  It's a formality.  The presidency began at noon, as everyone agrees.  Taft, in administering the oath to Hoover used the word """"maintain"""" instead of another word, I think it was preserve.

When I looked over the Wikipedia entry on personal attacks...it states that comments """"should be directed at content and actions rather than people.""""  Referring to somebody as a book burner clearly is directed at content (books) and actions (burning) rather than the person.  It's not a matter of who they are...it's a matter of what they are doing.

0,"`  Ed, it is not about ``perception``; it is what it is. Disco is a subgenre of rock with primary influence from soul and funk music which they themselves came from rhythm and blues/rock. Disco is more like uptempo soul or pop funk, whichever way you want to look at it, although such simple terms will be targeted (what genre label isn't?). Disco's real strong roots lie in the twist crazes of the early 60s spearheaded by Chubby Checker. Discotheques played soul records like Motown, records by Joey Dee & the Starliters, the Archies, Martha & The Vandellas, and even psychedelic funk such as Sly & The Family Stone's seminal ``Dance To the Music`` as well as other rock dance crazes. And yes, I'm very well aware of classical electronic music. The reason why there was an anti-disco backlash is the result of a number of factors including racism against gays and blacks, the saturation of disco singles on radio and in the market, etc. It is a complex issue. If you look back at articles during that time period, especially from Rolling Stone magazine, those factors are clearly highlighted. The Disco Demilition Night crowd and its DJ are mostly ignorants, straight up, but that is a different story. Most of them don't even know what rock n roll is, nor its roots. But to be fair, some funk enthusiasts and others from the black community have vilified the genre as well. If you'd like to know more, we can chat somewhere.  `"

Bringing into the argument the philisophical stance that we can't use the word ``humane`` at all becasue slavery is ``never humane`` is beside the point.

0,"`Lightning Bolt (Surfing Company)  Rumors swirl about the origin of the Lightning Bolt logo. Some say the Bolt was a graphic metaphor for a particularly strong strain of marijuana circulating the Hawaiian Islands in the late 1960s. Company co-founder Gerry Lopez fouls that off:  “IT WAS ABOUT THE ENERGY”  In 60s and into the 70s, Hawaiian surfers were energized by the Shortboard Revolution. Nat Young shook up the world with his “Total Involvement” surfing, taking his foot off the nose and on the tail of surfboards that were evolving shorter, lighter and faster by the season. In Hawaii, that meant mini-guns – light, narrow-backed pintails that were a universe away from the 10-foot elephant guns of the mid-1960s.  Mini-guns allowed surfers to boldly go where no surfers had gone before – deeper, faster, higher and lower: Deep into the gizzards of Pipeline, up high in the lip at Sunset, right into the Backdoor at Pipeline. And then there was Gerry Lopez. Standing 5' 8`` and weighing maybe 135 pounds, Lopez came flying out of the late 60s and into the 1970s, engulfed in Pipeline spit, standing limp in the eye of the storm, making something very difficult look like a cakewalk. Thousands of words and images have swirled around Lopez at Pipeline, but Tom Curren might have said it best: “It’s like letting an arrow fly.”  Lopez was the picture of cool and calm surfing The Pipeline when surfers were taking their sport back and taking it underground. Real surfers were appalled by what mainstream culture had done to surfing in the 1960s: Frankie and Annette riding the wild surf bom dip da dip da dip. It was phony BS into the 1970s, all of a sudden it was uncool to be cool. Be visible. Lopez was an exception to that. The world was mesmerized by a man who matched Pipeline’s power and beauty with grace. Lopez’ fast-twitch, German/Japanese physiology was part of the act, but what was under his feet was also important. Matt Warshaw detailed the influence of Gerry Lopez as figurehead/godhead in The Encyclopedia of Surfing: Lopez was the most-filmed surfer of his generation - a protracted Lopez-at-Pipeline sequence was part of nearly every surf movie made between 1971 and 1978, including Morning of the Earth (1972), Five Summer Stories (1972), Going Surfin’ (1974), Super Session (1975), Tales from the Tube (1975), and In Search of Tubular Swells (1977). Lopez needed surfboards that were as lithe, quick and fast as he was - so around 1970, Lopez teamed up with experienced Surf Line Hawaii store manager Jack Shipley to form an elite boutique for Hawaii’s best surfer/shapers.  The symbol was the Lightning Bolt and the symbol meant energy – the energy of Hawaiian surf, but also the energy of human physicality and artistry to make the surfboards to ride that energy deeper, faster and more radical. Gerry, BK, Reno and Tom Parrish, regarded as the most influential shapers in the Lightning Bolt stable, were surfers who mattered, making surfboards that mattered, for surfers that mattered: “It was an honor to work for Lightning Bolt,” Tommy Nellis said. “It was a very democratic place. They would accept your boards as long as they were accepted by the public. If your boards didn’t sell, it didn’t matter who you were. They appreciated consistency, and at that time in the surfboard business it was easy to be consistent.”  And the result was energy. Gerry Lopez dropping in at Pipeline or Barry Kanaiaupuni’s power-hula through the bowl at Sunset: The Lightning Bolt logo thundered throughout Hawaii, and then resonated across the Pacific and around the world – a combination of sincere talent, perfect timing and clever marketing of a needed product. Beautiful, finely-crafted Hawaiian guns were at the foundation of Lightning Bolt. This was a strikingly new era in surfing that was changing fast and dramatic. In free surfs and in competition – like the newfangled Pipeline Masters contest that began with a card table and a megaphone in 1971 – surfers and surfboards were evolving incredibly fast, and as the calendar clicked through the months and seasons of the early 1970s, Lightning Bolt became ubiquitous.  THE MARKETING STRATEGY WAS PRETTY SIMPLE : IF A SURFER WAS HOT, PUT A BOLT UNDER THEIR FEET & A QUIVER ON THEIR CAR.  A simple strategy that worked. Within the first half of the decade, the Lightning Bolt logo was ubiquitous in ads, magazine editorials and especially on the big screen. Not everyone had the time and money to travel to Hawaii and buy a bolt, or the skill to take over at Pipeline, Sunset and Waimea Bay. Lightning Bolt was a surfboard company first and last, but in the mid ‘70s the company moved into clothing: Nothing fancy, just practical trunks for surfing, and t-shirts for cruising. But the world wanted that Bolt energy, and the clothing line exploded like a spitting wave at the Pipeline.  A Pure source Since 1971  Lightning Bolt`"

0,"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I'd say you like Nintendo too much. ;)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:It's a good idea, now I think about it. I've been trying to think back to when bosses became popular (a mite difficult seeing as I would have been about five years old), and it seems that the flash point is in 1985.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:However, I am quite heavily biased toward scrolling shooters, so I'm probably missing something important. Bosses are, on the other hand, probably more important in scrolling shooters than any other genre, because they have to break up the linearity of the game.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Anyway. In 1985, you've that Mario game thingy, and Gradius, which is the first time I can recall having to fight a huge boss character. Then in 1986 you've got Darius, which is the earliest game I know of that had different bosses for every level. I think it had minibosses too.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:And then it really gets going. In 1987, I can name R-Type, Raiden, and Rainbow Islands as having distinct bosses, and by this point it was all pretty standard. But I'm just namedropping (and article-dropping too, seeing as I wrote most of those articles ;) ). The point is that there seems to be a dark age of bosses before 1985, so it would probably be interesting to unravel that.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The very earliest enemy-that-could-conceivably-be-thought-of-as-a-boss that I can think of (not including that Dungeons and Dragons thing mentioned in the article, which I know nothing about) is the Flag Ship from Gorf, an arcade game released in 1981, in the prime of the Space Invaders Era. Gorf was like five games in one, and when the player completed a level, they would move onto a level in the next game.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The fifth level was a battle with the Flag Ship. It has all the hallmarks of a boss: It's much bigger than the player's ship, much better armed, has its own forcefield, and is only minorly damaged by the player's weapon. The only way to destroy it is to hit it in its weak spot - a reactor situated deep within the ship.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Now I think about it, I don't know why I didn't mention this before. The thing is, I always thought of the Flag Ship as a 'level' rather than a boss. There wasn't really any concept of a boss at that point in history. Still, it's a start.  "

That is 7,000 articles we as a community have referenced in 17 days, and the pace will only increase as more wikiprojects get involved. I can reference 40 articles in a day, 1/3 of the 124 proposed, this is very doable folks.
I would strongly encouarge you to support this proposal. It is very doable. 
I am actively working to notify other wikiprojects of several tools, see for example:
User_talk:The-Pope#Your_idea_at_Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment.2FBiographies_of_living_people 
As User:The-Pope wrote on my talk page:
The WP:Australia project had a list of over 2000 names just over 2 weeks ago. It's now under 900.  900 is still fairly unworkable, so we've split them up again into smaller topics. Other lists have popped up, Cricket, Rugby union, India and probably many more.   This is all do-able, but it does take time, it does get a bit boring, it can be tempting for some editors to put the first google hit they see on it and remove the tag, but it can work.  One other good thing about these lists, is that you can use the related changes link to see all edits to them... great to keep an eye on pages without clogging up your watchlist (almost like having multiple watchlists). 
This is very possible. As an editor who strives to save almost all articles for the past 4 years, and who has fought so many policy argument to keep articles, this is a wonderful comprimise, with so much potential, I would hope that you would seriously consider this proposal.

I am responding to a question that was asked earlier in this comment chain:  https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/9v2wxy/youtubes_justification_for_banning_shirrako/e99bwqd/  People were discussing whether the problem with SJWs is that their ideas are fundamentally, conceptually bad, or if the problem is that they take good ideas and push them to such extremes they BECOME bad.  I contend that the problem is mostly the latter and offered the idea of safe spaces as an example.  In principle it's a reasonable idea that we advocate too, even if we don't use the same terminology.  We want our spaces, we want the places we've built to adhere to our values, we want escapism from our real life problems, we want someplace where we don't have to deal with feeling attacked as gamers.  These are fundamentally reasonable things to want.  The problem with SJWs is that they take the idea to an unreasonable extreme.  EVERYPLACE they go has to be a safe space, including places like universities that exist to train our minds and confront us with difficult, sometimes uncomfortable ideas.  And everyplace they go has to be a safe space for them and ONLY THEM, even if it means coming into other people's safe spaces, demanding it become THEIR safe space, and trying to take over and kick out the existing occupants.  That's the problem, not the existence of safe spaces in and of itself.  You are absolutely right about the separation principle, we are content to be safe in our safe space, to leave other people alone in theirs, and to suck it up and deal with the rest of the world NOT being a safe space.  They aren't, and that's the problem.  But you are kneejerk attacking an argument I am not making."

 The number 30 was used by myself for very good reasons.  You yourself have stated that 29 matrix schemes are still operational - a figure drawn I believe from the matrixwatch.org website.  As my own matrix scheme - www.cyberama.net - is operational but classified as non-operational by matrixwatch.org (why I do not know!), then 30 must be the minimum number of matrix schemes operational currently.  As stated before, this is a conservative number - I personally believe that there are far more but this would be unverifiable without some intense work verifying all known matrix scheme domains.   

 To include the number of matrix sites that have ceased trading would be hard if not impossible - there is no proof that any domains that would be claimed by anyone were ever matrix schemes.  If domains have expired, there is no evidence that either they ever existed or what their content consisted of.  Therefore, I feel it is unverifiable to state any given number of matrix schemes that may have ceased trading.  Stating that many have ceased trading is the best solution, in my opinion.   

 In my mind, the term """"operational"""" regarding a website would mean that it was viewable and that it is possible for it to operate.  Therefore, any matrix scheme that is able to take payment should be regarded as being operational.  www.dictionary.com defines the term as, """"Fit for proper functioning; ready for use"""".  I would have to say that as both Arzel personally and matrixwatch.org have stated that they 'know' 29 matrix schemes are operational, it is silly for them now to backstep and try and say that there is no way to 'know' these sites are operational.   

 Would it be of additional help in the History section to include details on Gotmatrix?  This was also a very well-known matrix scheme that is apparently still operational and trading - and is one of the older websites too.  Greg, the owner, is still answering emails - when he chooses!

 Can someone explain criticism #6 to me? 

This is taken from the criticisms section of the article:

6. Since logic is inherently constant, and that some things are more true than others, it means that """"strong"""" relativism cannot hold true under many conditions. Relativism often ignores how views have different weight to another. An example of a similar phenomenon is the Gay Marriage debate in the U.S. - an example where the majority dictates the rights of the entirety even when it doesn't apply to them, as they do not weigh up the effects of their views. 

Can someone explain what exactly this means? 
I do not follow the first half of the paragraph (the one that actually pertains to relativism), and the example reads as complete nonsense to me, especially this part:

""""...the majority dictates the rights of the entirety even when it doesn't apply to them, as they do not weigh up the effects of their views.""""

I do not think that:
a) The majority in question believes that """"it"""" doesn't apply to them. (Though I'm not sure what """"it"""" is in this context, so the sentence may be true.) The majority believes that allowing gay marriage would undermine the moral standards of their society, which, of course, applies to everybody in that society.
b) The majority in question does not """"weigh up the effects of its views"""". Its views are that gay marriage should not be allowed, for the benefit of society; it is aware of the effects; and does not object to them.  """

 ::* Let's all  pull in our claws and be  cool, before the situation escalates any further.  But let's also understand, , that you are responsible in no small way for what we've seen in the last few days and, especially, what we see at the Google Group   .  Your """"brother"""" is having a severe episode for which he bears responsibility for himself - he is an adult, after all; but you certainly played a part in aggravating it with your unproven accusations.  I have to say that I am somewhat amazed that you still haven't figured out who from whom during the YouTube discussions or subsequent to them, but regardless, Jason would not have behaved as he did if it wasn't for you and your passing of your unproven assertions.  Clearly, you do seem to pull his strings and what  has said cannot be dismissed so blithely.  Whatever I have come to think of  in the fairly short time that I have had to encounter him, he is chronologically young and psychologically much younger.  You are older, you appear to be a bit more intelligent, if not much more mature, you're at least moderately  more successful and, theoretically, at least, you should know better.  You told Jason that I was someone else - someone you both hate.  You not only failed to prove your accusations, but you deleted a number of disproofs that I provided and dismissed or scoffed at the rest.  You were left with no evidence, but you made the accusations, anyway and when that didn't satisfy you, you passed those on to someone I am sure you know has some issues with maturity - .  Anyone with any clue about basic psychology could have predicted the results.  As simple-minded as Jason is, it was all that he needed.   
 ::* Jason brought you here as a meatpuppet, and I've read enough of your past arguments with others to know that you have been thought of as the lapdog for him; but my reading has been different.  I agree with .  I believe that it's been you pulling the strings all along.  I wonder if you're proud of yourself.  Jason was never a match for me and it's certain he'd never pass muster with site administration and be allowed back in because of his antics, as I have described in detail.  But if it haden't been for you and your baseless and false accusations, there might have been some hope to reach him.  My comments were intended to get him to think about what is going on.  They may have succeeded or failed, but your accusations made it effectively impossible, because he clearly looks up to you, and he and you clearly hate , , and atheists, agnostics, and religionists other than Christians, in general.  You had a responsibility to your """"brother,"""" who looks up to you, and you blew it. 
 ::* I'd suggest to you that you have a lot to think about and considerable for which you need to make amends, but we already know that I'll be whistling in the wind, don't we?  You're not rational.  You believe things because because they are convenient for you, you can't fathom or understand alternatives, or because you want to believe them.  There's very little that you believe that you can actually show to be true, so you create this psychological wall for yourself and declare that you have """"no burden of proof.""""  You'll complain that you made that statement with respect to evidence for God, but I submit to you that you extrapolate that to all other areas of your life and experience at varying levels.  There isn't anything that you truly believe - about God or anybody - because you can actually prove anything.  You're a superficial thinker who, while spouting occasionally speeches and quoting the Bard, really don't like to give too much contemplative thought to anything, especially if it leads to possible conclusions that you can't bear.  I'd be sad for you because of what that takes away from you, except that your behavior over the past several years in so many forums makes it clear to me that there's something about you that, I don't know, makes it all moot. 
 ::* Regardless, you manipulated the situation.  Whether you did so consciously or not, you helped create a more hostile environment than was really necessary under the circumstances.  I bear my own responsibility, but I can hold my head up because I was honest, truthful, direct, had good intentions, and had a desire to defend the integrity of the Project, through and through.

If faggot didn't mean homosexual then why all the other references to homosexuality? Obviously the distinction isn't quite as clear as you imply it is."

The Republican party, being mostly conservative both fiscally and culturally, should advocate lesser spending, right?  Not always, Ronald Reagan was conservative in the eyes of the population, but he boosted govt. spending by 50%.  George Bush has spent 12 billion $ in Iraq per moth.  I'm mentioning this because people who advocate a certain belief don't always do exactly as what their side of the spectrum demands, this is how I see it.  Also, one thing, I believe that Fascism is far-right because it embodies the corporate state, the companies who served Hitler, for example, were in fact private.  Hitler kept competition to a minimum.

This whole """"'m right, you're wrong"""" attitude is pising me off, please act more responsibly and actually consider other peoples views. All what the new section does is point out the possible confusion that some authors, and perhaps readers of the article might have over the geber discovery and point out that this is likely not to be true.

My two main suggestions are to make smaller improvements to the article and to use more than one source. Unless you are very skilled at proper paraphrasing, using a single source greatly increases the risk of close paraphrasing, i.e. improper paraphrasing, and also leads to a very one-sided view of the subject. I've added two reference to the article with links to their pages on Google books (most of which are visible, at least in the UK). The print copies may also be in the Longy library:
Marco, Tomás (1993). Spanish Music in the Twentieth Century. 
Draayer, Suzanne Rhodes (2009). Art Song Composers of Spain: An Encyclopedia
The previous reference I had added—Romero, Justo (2004). Liner Notes: Joaquín Turina (1882–1949): Piano Music, Vol. 1—is also very useful, especially for discussing his musical style and works chronology. I suggest you use these as your sources for further expansion with the biography on joaquinturina.com] as a back-up only.
 
One thing you could do is separate out the last paragraph (beginning with """"His works include..."""") with its own heading Music and expand the commentary there. For example, he was a very noted composer of art song, which is given short shrift in the article. Much has been written about his approach to incorporating Spanish musical idiom in his work and on his style in general, including its strengths and weaknesses. This is also lacking in the article.
 
Another possibility, is to separate out a section at the beginning of biography to Early years where you discuss his family background and his musical education prior to Paris. The material between that section and Music could be entitled Paris and Madrid and can always be expanded in the future.
 
A third possibility is to expand and rationalize the list of works in the article. The current one has three major problems. First, it excludes many of his important works because it relies solely on those scores available at IMSLP. Secondly, it gives no indication of each work's type. Thirdly, it gives no indication of the date of their composition. Listing them alphabetically, is not a good way to go. If you do decide to concentrate on improving the works list, I suggest using List of compositions by Claude Debussy by genre as a model, although in this case, the list would not be a separate article, but rather continue to appear in the Selected works section of Joaquín Turina.
 
Hope that helps. Best,   """

 Langus, Wikipedia policy mandates that articles should be self-contained. If an assertion is used in an article, both the assertion and its use must be justified in that article. The assertion that """"Britain re-established its rule"""" has never been made in scholarly texts and is a WP:FRINGE theory. Jimbo Wales has stated:  

 *If a viewpoint is in the majority, then it should be easy to substantiate it with reference to commonly accepted reference texts;  
 *If a viewpoint is held by a significant minority, then it should be easy to name prominent adherents;  
 *If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it does not belong in  
 Wikipedia regardless of whether it is true or not and regardless of whether you can prove it or not, except perhaps in some ancillary article. 

 We have not been provided with citations to either reference texts or prominent authors supporting the viewpoint that Britain re-established its rule in 1833. Therefore the claim does not belong in Wikipedia. 

 In your discussions with WCM, he just muddled the waters by taking the debate to whether it is true or not that Britain ruled the islands before 1833. We need not delve into that. The only thing that matters here is if the reliable sources available support that view.

 I suggested three things which I will now restate and elaborate on: 
 # If you are capable of intelligent conversation:  
 :Neither of you have taken part in the open and earnest discussions above. This disqualifies you from asserting revert privileges.  
 # If you back up your opinions with sources 
 :You are both more than capable of citing Gary Francione, and particularly notable and respected philosophers in the area of animal rights. I admit I have read very little of that author, but what little I have read tells me that while he may be an regarded as an intellectual giant, his arguments are not based in sound science, nor are they based in sound philosophy, and even though he may be regarded as an authority in the context of animal rights arguments, he is not an unbiased source, and SlimVirgin and Viriditas' reference to a most biased source as an authority is at best a violation of WP:WEIGHT. Viriditas took issue with my insertion of the anthropomorphism concept into what she first claimed was a quote, and afterwards claimed was incorrect due to what your favourite author says, simply: """"It is not a matter of anthropomorphism."""" So the prophet says. There are no doubt some critics among the 58,000 hits for """"animal rights + anthropomorphism"""" 
 . My impression is that the actual depth of the above mentioned author's refutation """"its not a matter of anthropomorphism"""" does not go much deeper. Like many pop-psychology writers, he seems to simply slide from conjecture to conjecture without actually stopping long enough to give his conjectures any substance. In any case, even citing the most revered philosophers is not a proper way to start an article, unless they have said in a cogent way what the subject is.  
 # In a properly written lede, in vogue writers such as Francione do not have ownership of the concept of animal rights, even though they may be regarded highly. There have been a great many people making various animal rights arguments, and frankly the weaker arguments do weigh down the concept in the overall balance. A general lead for a topical article does not clean up a topic just to make it look better, and neutral ethical writers do not conjure POV terms like """"non-human animals"""" and """"other sentient beings"""" and call them neutral.  
 # Back up your usage of those sources in accord with a neutral point of view. This seems to be a difficult part for you ladies. You can claim that your favourite pet sources are authoritative, and yet fail to see how those sources may be biased activists whom cannot be relied upon to give a neutral overview of the subject. Their pedigrees alone do not suffice, they actually have to be good at thinking. WP:WEIGHT is indeed my main argument against using such writers such as the one's you suggest as absolute authorities, as they are indisputably motivated by activist concerns. I'll give Francione gets the last word (emphasis mine): """"Nonhumans [..] certainly do have cognitive states which are equivalent to human beliefs, desires, etc."""" - ( |  |  """

And not only that, but you catastrophically misunderstood the concept of citing sources anyway.  The wording in the source is irrelevant.  The information in the source is what matters.  All in all, your conduct has been a disgrace. If you don't want to look like a troll, you should go over to that talk page and apologise for reverting with such an inadequate reason.  2.220.204.70  """

 Regarding your email 
Go ahead.  32 
I've looked things over.  I don't see anything that requires a block or administrative action in any way.  This is a new user who is unfamiliar with Wikipedia's conflict of interest guidelines and needs to be gently directed that way.  Ask him to use the article talk page and discuss the matter cordially with him.  The sort of things you sent me go one many times every day on Wikipedia.  I could find a dozen or more conversations in the last 24 hours that look functionally identical to the one you sent me, and it isn't particularly unusual or out of the norm.  It's just someone who is unfamiliar with Wikipedia, and upset because they don't understand how Wikipedia works.  In the spirit of WP:DOLT we need something like WP:DOCOI: Don't Overlook Conflicts of Interest.  People with conflicts of interest may have valid concerns about article content, we shouldn't brush them off as though they don't have something valuable to add to the discussion.  We should instead try to work with them in alleviating their concerns, or at least educate them in Wikipedia's policies (keeping in mind they are an outsider).  Be gentle and clear.  That's my advice.  Also, direct him to express his concerns on-wiki rather than via email; discussions of article content should happen in the open.  32 

Wondering what you think
Hello TOJ. I agree with your removal of the multitude of run times in the Once Upon a Time in America. On the other hand I would ask you to consider including the European run time of 229 minutes. Various considerations include the fact that runtime is the one that premiered at Cannes also we include both the Cannes and US release dates in the infobox and we could label the two runtimes the same way. One other thing, while I can't remember the exact time frame but I know the 229m version did get showings in the US within a few months (maybe weeks) of the short versions release because, much like the two releases of Brazil, I held off going to the theater until I could see the longer version. If you disagree that is okay this was just a suggestion. If you want to move this discussion to the films talk page that is okay too. Cheers and have a good week.  | Talk 
I agree with you.  If the 229 min. version was show at Cannes, that time should be in the infobox.  That was a mistake on my part.  Thanks for letting me know. -The '45

 == He's Dead, John == 
 From the episode """"The Cost of Living"""". To paraphrase Star Trek's """"Bones"""" McCoy droll facts of life and death in space. I suppose that the actor who played Mr. Eko unintendedly did a favor to the producers and writers by having the plot move in a different direction, sans the Eko character. As we've come to know the situation, the MIB was the Smoke Monster, and the contentious rival on the island with Jacob for control. Since it's been established that the monster can assume the form of dead corspes on the island, and uses them to manipulate the survivors there (ultimately to their demise,)and by lying and otherwise driving ppl insane to expediate its ends, then Mr. Eko's death was a stroke of luck for the 815 crew. Why would I say this? It's because Eko was  A WILD CARD AND A MAD DOG!!!  With his volatile and warped personality (as mass murderer-turned-guilt-ridden-and-pentative-man-of-the-cloth) this was the made-for order perscription of a potentially perfect killing tool to exterinate the survivors, AND even perhaps the """"Others"""", as Eko was uniquly capable of.  We've seen how """"Smokey"""" successfully drove and manipulated Russeau, and later Calire to do his bidding to kill as many of the inhabitants on the island as possible. With Eko, MIB had the """"trifecta"""" puppet: Meancing strength and prowess, religious fervor, and needy for direction and purpose.  The """"815"""" people really didn't understand whom or what they had in their midst. Perhaps Ben Linus did! """"Smokey"""" wanted to use Eko ASAP, so while the nefarious Nigerian was recuperating from his attack by the """"Dharma Bears"""", """"Smokey"""" arranged a terrifying image to Mr. Eko that the latter was well familiar with (that being the image of SHANGO'S FIREY JUSTICE. As the legend goes in the West African Orisha myths, Shango, the original Thunder God, was also the diety of swift and exacting justice; he would send the """"dancing fire"""" to chase the guilty out of every abode of safety and rest until the evil one confessed. Bravo to the writers  and the actor for insering this into the plot). When confronted with """"Smokey"""", using Eko's  dead brother Demme to manipulate him, the Monster gets a big surprise and learns that Eko, in his own mind, doesn't think he's done anything wrong, as he thought he was protecting his brother. This curously enrages the monster who quickly and gruesomely dispatches Eko. Perhaps """"Smokey"""" surmised that Eko was too volatile even for """"it"""" to manipulate, and therfore was of no use to him in any attempt to kill the island's inhabitants. Moral of this episode is that one should never trust a religious fanatic of any stripe. Just like those two hapless fools who recently DELIBERATELY sailed into Somali waters and let themselves be captured, and quickly killed by the cosairs. All in the name of """"faith"""".

This section really needs cleaning up.

Some of them are completely useless (""""Mattitude is practiced in 100 countries""""). That's all the bitching and whining I can think of ATM, but yeah.

Yes, but is it really necessary to have these (especially this many of them) on his page? 
and some of them a while back were really inappropriate,like..well i dont think i need to go there,i hope not..

Yeah, only the Downfall and the Twist of Fate are his finishers, so stop everyone!

 He didn't call it that, someone else (the name escapes me at the moment) used the Twist of Fate and called it the JLT, as far as I'm aware. Talk to me!

Hi , I see that the article in question is one that you have created yourself, good job! However, it contains a number of issues apart from the one that you have just stated(encyclopaedic tone). The page has no real references apart from the club website, so statement like """"This step taken by him was heavily condemned by the Bagan fans"""" seems to be your personal opinion. Here is a grammatical mistake: """"..Bagan confirmed the signing of an well experienced.."""". These are just a couple of examples.

Please correct these issues. If you feel that I have made a mistake, please report it to other editors/admins and I'm sure they will resolve the issue for you.

0,"`* V, you make yourself ridiculous, because this subject is so well documented. Read about George White. CIA MKULTRA ran San Fransisco clubs prior to the hippy movement which emerged from that town, where patrons were 'spiked' with LSD. Ken Kesey learnt about LSD through his involvement in CIA MKULTRA experiments. He was a core figure in the burgeoning hippy movement. LSD did not leak into the 'youth culture' merely from medical sources, CIA had bought the majority of the world's supply of LSD, and this was a source and influence to the 'youth culture' movement just as important as Tim Leary. Even if you believe that the CIA kept its LSD well regulated, the internal CIA culture is not seperate from the US general culture to the degree you would purport to support your 'skepticism'. The experiences that the CIA officers and experimental subjects were having with LSD is just as legitimate an influence on culture as any other individuals experiences. 'Culture' includes and intermixes influences from everyone, CIA are not exempt, as much as some would like to pretend they are. ``We are all in this together,`` this ``lifeboat earth,`` this ``floating island in space``.

0,"`:The following was written as a reply to your message on my talk page, and it refers to the text of that message. Normally, I reply to a message on the talk page where it is posted, to avoid fragmenting discussion, but since you have also posted a message to me here, and since it concerns you more than me, I am posting my reply here.  :First of all, you say ``sorry for this``, but no apologies are necessary. I am sure that everything you did was done in good faith, and all of us, when we first start to edit Wikipedia, don't know all the policies, guidelines, etc, so there is no blame to be attached to anyone who perfectly innocently does things which they then find are not considered acceptable. I should think very few of us manage to do any significant editing of Wikipedia without making some sort of mistakes.  :There are several issues here. I will try to deal with the ones that I think are most important.  :You say that permission has been given for use of the content. However we can't take the unsubstantiated word of just anyone who chooses to create a Wikipedia account that they have copyright permission. This is not just some kind of pedantry: unfortunately, people do come here and lie about such issues. Just yesterday I was looking at the case of someone who has over several years repeatedly lied about copyright permission, forged evidence of such permission, and used multiple Wikipedia accounts to do so. I am giving you, below, information about how to give copyright permission to Wikipedia. However, I still suggest that that may not be a useful way forward, for several reasons. Granting permission under the relevant licensing terms will mean that permission is give for anyone at all, anywhere in the world, to reuse the text, as it is or modified however they like, for any purpose, including their own commercial use, subject to minimal requirements, essentially no more than providing a link to show where they got the content from. In practice, there are very few organisations or businesses that are willing to license their web-site content so freely, and it is very unlikely that an organisation which puts ``© Tinkatolli ApS`` without further qualification at the bottom of its web pages will be willing to do so. There is no such thing as licensing text for use only on Wikipedia, because anything posted to any Wikipedia page is automatically released under free licensing terms. Also, even if Tinkatolli ApS is willing to change its copyright licensing terms in that way, it is doubtful whether there will be any point in doing so. The result would be that reuse by anyone anywhere in the world would be allowed for ever, just so that the content would be posted temporarily to a userspace page to be edited to make it less promotional. (Contrary to what many people think, it is not possible for me even to restore the information to a user-space page to be edited without copyright permission. Knowingly posting copyright-infringing content to a page on a publicly viewable website is illegal, and having the word ``user`` in the title at the top of the page doesn't change that.) A much better way forward is for me to email the content to you, so that you can edit it off Wikipedia. However, please note that if you choose to take this option, it must not be posted to any page at all on Wikipedia while copyright-infringing content is still there. Let me know if you want me to email it to you.  :You wrote ``The first reason you had mentioned it looks like for promotion only, it isn't, it's well known and has a big audience...`` I am not at all sure what you think ``promotion`` means, but it has nothing whatever to do with how well known the subject is. I should think that, at the last United States presidential election campaign, Barack Obama was one of the best known people in the world, and certainly better known than Tinkatolli, but taht does not detract from teh fact that he and his supporters mounted a massive campaign to promote him. Such language as, for example``Tinkatolli inspires kids to create, move, think and give in the game and away from the computer`` is unambiguously promotional, and the whole article was permeated by such promotional writing.  :Finally, as I said I would do, I will give you information on how to give Wikipedia copyright permission. As I have already explained, I don't recommend taking that option, but it is up to you if you wish to.  ::If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text—which means allowing other people to modify it—then you may include on the external site the statement ``I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later, and the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.`` You may also e-mail or mail the Foundation to release the content.

Factual accuracy

There are at least three ways to view these events.  Let """"a=Persecution of Christians by some Jews; A=Institutional persecution of Christians by Jews; let B=Christian persecution of Jews

First, the perspective that we all reject: The Jews persecuted the Christians and this justifies 2000 years of Christian anti-semitism.  This is """"A happened AND A justifies B"""".

Second, the perspective that is, I believe, the mainstream position: Some Jews persecuted the Christians.  Enough so that the Christians viewed this or, at least, cast this as an institutional rejection of Christianity (culminating the hypothesized Council of Jamnia).  The polemic and conflict arising out of this sectarian conflict colored Christian attitudes, policies and behavior towards Jews for the next 2000 years.  This anti-Semitism is rooted in the original conflict between Jews and Christians during the formative years of early Christianity.  However, most people today reject the notion of the events providing any legitimate justification for anti-Semitism.  This is """"A happened; A was used to justify B BUT many people argue A does not justify B"""".

Third, the perspective that some liberal theologians are pushing: The NT account is ahistorical because there is no corroborating evidence outside the New Testament or the writings of the church fathers.  (Note:  Forgive me if I am overstating the position.)  According to this perspective, the persecutions either never happened or were exaggerated by either the NT authors or later interpreters of the NT authors.  For example, it is possible that the incidents in the NT represent isolated incidents and do not represent an institutional policy.  Later events (post Bar Kokhba) may have led to a re-interpretation of the isolated events into a perception of institutional policy.  This is """"A never happened; a happened; A was used to justify B BUT many people argue A does not justify B"""".

I believe that all of these perspectives (yes, even the first one) should be presented in the article.  We should give """"due weight"""" to each perspective citing sources who support each view. 

Finally, I think that we are agreed that we should not say """"Jews persecuted the Christians"""" but rather """"According to the NT, Jews persecuted the Christians"""".  If this formulation were used uniformly throughout the article, would there still be a dispute over factual accuracy?

From what I can tell, the bare facts of the matter are that you made edits to a number of LDS-related articles, and those edits were reverted by various editors, myself included.  Now, there are two main ways of viewing these facts: one, that your edits were consistent with Wikipedia policy and the editors who reverted them were not justified in doing so; two, that your edits were not consistent with Wikipedia policy and the other editors were justified in reverting them.  This is why I asked you about your understanding of Wikipedia policy  you are relatively new here, and despite your confidence that your edits were appropriate, my view of them was that they violated several policies and guidelines.  (It's natural for newcomers to take some time learning the ropes, so it doesn't imply any malice on your part.)  Since the heart of the conflict seems to be how you and I regard your edits in light of WP policy, it seems best to isolate the points of policy where our understanding differs, in hopes that we can establish areas of common ground from which we can work out other differences (or at least agree about what we irreconcilably disagree).  It would be helpful, though, to know that you've indeed read the pertinent policies, so that we can speak with the same lingo and refer to the same general ideas.  Have you done this?

0,"`  == GA Review == After reviewing the article according to the Good Article Criteria, I have to decline the article's nomination for GA status at this time for concerns that are listed below. While reviewing, I also looked to for comparison the Eric Bana, Uma Thurman and Julia Stiles articles. I encourage the article's editors to look to those pages as examples and guides for what this article could become.  1. It is well written. - Pass * There were some minor copy edits that took the liberty of correcting but overall the article seems to pass this criteria with no glaring violation of WP:MOS. 2. It is factually accurate and verifiable. - Needs Improvement * There was some ``citation needed`` tags prior to the review that need to be cited.  * Considering the sensitive nature of BLP's, I would also look into citing some of the ``dating history`` with reliable sources. Some celebrities consider that information private and personal. Having that type of information attached to a strong reliable source would not only put that info in the clear but would also help curb the insertions of ``dubious former lovers`` into the paragraph.   3. It is broad in its coverage. - Needs Improvement *Outside of a brief mention of the ``dim pretty boys`` characterization, there is not really any coverage on Kutcher's acting reputation and how it is perceived by the critics and mainstream viewers alike. What is his acting style like? What do critics say are his strengths and weakness? What do movie studios or viewers think of his box office draw? Are there any director's quotes about working with him? 4. It follows the neutral point of view policy - Needs Improvement * I would rework the Selected Filmography section to be more comprehensive (looks like you're missing 5-7 projects). The very description ``selected`` is POV oriented in that it is using some unknown (and presumably un-objective) criteria for inclusion in the list.  5. It is stable - Pass * The article is a bit of a vandal target but the editors are prompt in maintaining the integrity of the article. Overall the article seems to have progressed gracefully in development. 6. It contains images, where possible, to illustrate the topic. - Needs Improvement * The article has images but part of the criteria is that the all the images included be properly tagged (Criteria 6a). Image:Welling and kutcher.jpg has a deletion notice due to improper sourcing.    I encourage the editors to consider renominating after the above concerns have been addressed. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.  `"

Related to the images btw also agree, but there was one edit i was really unsure and motivated to start that section, quotation ...General Hospital, Ernakulam and Kochi Medical College... Latter, in fact Co-operative Medical College, Kochi imho seems to be a 'bad name', and also as of 17.1.15 imho unsourced, although started 18:00, 9 July 2011‎ by another user before.

0,"  :That's a very fair question. The answer is that there have been several court cases in which this very dispute has been at issue – besides George Harrison's 19th-century case, the main recent test case is that of Tim Saunders (around 1980ish? – I've got the date somewhere or other), who argued he didn't have to pay the poll tax because the Stannary Parliament had vetoed it in Cornwall. His case was thrown out, so the dispute remains unsettled. Besides the revived Stannators themselves, I'd actually suggest the people of Cornwall as a whole are party to the debate – and I don't just say this as a Cornish nationalist, Britain's a democracy, so its constitutional questions are a concern of the people. :There's also a sense in which it doesn't matter whether Cornwall is an ordinary county or not, and that is the question of whether we should think of Cornwall as part of England in any kind of non-legal sense. Think about the status of Merionethshire in the 1880s. Legally it was just an ordinary county of England-and-Wales; yet it clearly belonged to a specific 'country', if you like, namely Wales. Conceivably, then, Cornwall could be (legally) an ordinary county of England-and-Cornwall, but a 'country' of its own in a different way. :I know what you mean, in a sense – it doesn't seem like much of a dispute if Cornwall County Council isn't taking part. But look at all the controversy surrounding this very article (and the first paragraph of Cornwall, from which this article springs) – if it isn't a dispute, what do we call it?  "

0,"`  == just wondering ==  Dear Ellen of the Roads, I see that wp:no legal threats says ``Rather than blocking immediately, administrators should seek to clarify the user's meaning and make sure that a mere misunderstanding is not involved.`` I wonder whether you could explain that in relation to your action?   `"
0,"`   :I have several points regarding the recent discussion.  1) I believe that BruceHallman's statement that the phrase ``generally assocatied with the United State's princples and interests`` conforms to WP:V, WP:NPOV AND WP:NOR is incorrect.  First, I believe that the Heritage foundation source he uses, as pointed out by David Oberst, is not being interperted correctly.  Simply because countries that are rated ``free`` by Freedom House are generally more supportive of United States interests does not mean that Freedom House's rating are generally associated with United State's intersts.  After all, the long-time US ally Saudi Arabia is treated very harshly by Freedom House.  The summary of the Heritage foundation report does not accurately reflect the assertions in the report which in fact states the opposite, ``As nations become freer, both politically and economically, the policies that they consider to be in their interests become more closely aligned with policies championed by the U.S.not because they are U.S. policies, but because they are policies consistent with the interests of free societies.``  This means that the verification for that statement is not valid.  In addition, even if it were quoted accurately, the Heritage Foundations stated goal is to ``formulate and promote conservative public policies;`` they are not a neutral source.  (Indeed, most of the sources for this artical are not neutral sources but are sources with strong bias one way or the other.)  Citing other's opinions, while they are verifiable, does not make them neutral.   :2) BruceHallman is correct, however, in questioning Ultramarine's suggestion that the test of if something is valid is if it reflects how Freedom House describes itself.  Freedom House itself is not a neutral source, and while they may be a good source for some parts of the article (such as when they were founded or who the chairman of their board is) descriptions of their ideology, goals, etc. should probably be cited as ``Freedom House's states`` etc.  Simply because Freedom House doesn't describe itself a certian way doesn't necessarly mean that it isn't valid. :3) Saying that Freedom House is ``generally associated with US interests`` isn't necessarly a critisim; however, it is not a statement of fact, either.  Merely the fact that it has been debated so much on this talk page indicates that it is not a verifiable fact, but rather a matter of some contention.  I will outline how I think the article could be better constructed to include the differing opinions of Freedom House in the next bullet point, but I think that the introduction should probably be saved for things that are clearly true, and not things that are up for debate. :4) I feel that if the article is restructured slightly and the primary editors of this article (which, lately, seem to be BruceHallman and Ultramarine, who clearly have different views of Freedom House as an organization) could agree on this structure, it would save a lot of debate.  I think the introduction of the article should state basic, verifiable facts (What they are, where they are headquartered, where they are located, and the fact that they are best known for publishing books).  A statement saying that their political agenda is a matter of contention might also be included to indicate not everyone things that they are all sunshine and roses.  I think the next section should be ``History and Organization`` and outline when and by whom they were founded, it's organization structure, the fact that the board is mostly American, it's funding, and it's membership in other organization.  I think that the bit about what their activities (both in the historical section and in the organization section with the quote) should be moved to the next section, ``Activities.``  The Activities (though that is maybe a bad heading) would include the above statements of what Freedom House's claims of prior activities are, the fact that they publish book and details of those books, and the information contained in the ``other activities`` section.  The final section, I think should be titled something along the lines of ``Political Leanings, Agenda, and Controversy`` or something, and would be a space for the differing views of Freedom House to be discussed.  The validity (or lack their of) of their ratings, if they are bias in favor of an Ameri-centric point of view, and if they are neo-cons or not could be discussed here.  If the proceding sections are well written, they will be limited to things that can be easily verified, and all the debate about if Freedom House is good or bad will be contained in this section.     Calling this section ``Criticisms`` has implications that I don't think are necessarly correct. : `"

I notice that this RfC is dead but SH just removed a sock's comment. I actually do think this conversation is fine staying open since there is not consensus and inclusion v not is essentially WP:FREQUENT. I did not notice NickCT's comment until now but wanted to address it since we have already gone over this but people seem to forget or have to rattle it off everytime it comes up. I for one think """"massacre"""" in some form should be mentioned in the lead. Unfortunately, the assertion that it is what """"people involved call it"""" is contradicted by the following:
Gaza Victory: enough said but just a reminder, it can't be a massacre and a victory can it?
""""Gaza Massacre"""" has been disputed as a title with the sources mirroring its forced use on Wikipedia
Hamas did not have an official name for it. This has been discussed and it is a point conceded by those in favor of inclusion. Hamas simply did not use its limited PR capabilities to clearly lay this out as their preferred title (see point 1).
But back to my point of keeping this open. I have offered two solutions. Nableezy has rejected at leas one of them. 
Include """"it has been called a massacre"""". No bold. Not an alternative title. Just simply lay it out there. One editor recently provided a source calling it """"Massacre in Gaza"""". It was obviously referred to as a massacre. 
or
Include every title that was verifiably used in RS at a ratio of tens of thousands to one. This could be accomplished by actually adding information in the lead about the media and its relation t this topic. This would increase the quality of the article by meeting WP:LEAD] by being an actual summary. 
I'm not going to lie, I think it is time to change the title of this article altogether.  notice that other language's Wikipedia projects refer to it as the Israeli operational name (some editors have equated this to POV even though it is a very common and accurate title) or one laying out the dates and calling it a conflict (as we used to do but it was really long). That discussion will eventually come up again and any decision here will get scuttled by it (or the opposite). But it is clear that giving prominence to a very little used and POV dripping title in the lead is not acceptable to many editors without thoughtful balancing. Two easy options are presented to you. It is my hope that the word massacre is used in the lead but how to do it is a hurdle. And add on top of that that we still don't even have a good main title and it shows that this process has been broken since day 1. Day 1 was years ago.  03:16, 28"""

 """"Mecca""""? 

""""JMU's reputation as a party school also further strains its relation with the community, as student housing surrounding the university has long been a mecca for underaged drinking. Many in the community stereotype the students because of this reputation, leading to further strain between each group""""

I won't disagree- there are Harrisonburg residents who are concerned about the relationship between the city and the university, but I can't help but think the above statement is overkill. The first clause, """"JMU's reputation as a party school also further strains its relation with the community"""", seems suitable enough to make the point (despite being grammatically unstable). The second bit, """"It has long been a mecca for underage drinking"""" is inappropriate, however. 

Mecca is a city in Saudi Arabia, regarded as the holiest meeting site in Islam, and it is not an accurate literal description of social life around JMU. The use of the word """"Mecca"""" in this context could be offensive regardless of any religious affiliation.

Again, I acknowledge that there is tension between the community and JMU due in part to excessive partying, but still- that entire paragraph is based largely on opinion. I would appreciate knowing specifically what these community stereotypes are, and how they are known.  

Hopefully I am doing this right... sorry if this seems like a """"personal attack"""". Never done the Wikipedia thing."""

 ==Amy Winehouse== 

 You have deleted a lot my edits on this topic lately. I understand that this is the type of thing you have to live with if you decide to edit a Wikipedia article. All I ask is for consistency. I have used the British tabloids because they have been a lot more accurate then the official spokespeople who keep on claiming some variation of exhaustion. Recently I did not use a cite where one of her family members predicted disaster if her husband did go to jail. I did not use it because I was afraid my edit would get deleted because it was from a tabloid and there were already family member quotes in the section. Considering the events that followed I now feel I ill served our readers by not putting it in. I did put back in the tour managers claim that he quit because he was tested positive for heroin based on second hand smoke from her because it was from ABC News a major American Network and not a tabloid and therefore a reliable cite based on any guideline one might use. Deciding the reliability of the tour manager is not a decision for you or me to make but that news organization. I have refrained so far from putting back deletions from British tabloid cites because I am American and feel that British editors would have a better understanding of their tabloids then I do. But I notice that half the cites in the article remain from the Mirror,Mail,Sun etc. So if my cites from the same sources are getting deleted I do have to wonder. As I said earlier all I ask for is consistency. I will gladly abide by a rule that only the BBC,Times of London, Guardian and that type of source can be used but if but if """"tabloid"""" sources are going to be used please then let me make judgments on reliability.

1,"Noam Chomsky: Pa, recimo, u slučaju da talibansko obrazovanje potiče iz Madrasa u Pakistanu, tada ga financira naš glavni saveznik, Saudijska Arabija, a inicijativa za to je došla od Reaganove administracije – pošto je to tada spadalo u dio pomoći Pakistanu, prvenstveno uslijed rata protiv Rusije. Prema tome, Sjedinjene Države su nastojale zadržati Ruse u Afganistanu, a govoreći o pobuni šef stožera CIA-e u Islamabadu vrlo je eksplicitno iznio pravi razlog. Rekao je da nas nije briga za oslobađanje Afganistana, nego je cilj da što više Rusa budu ubijeni. Pozamašan dio te pomoći bila je naša podrška najgoroj diktaturi u Pakistanu, diktaturi generala Zia-ul-Haqa, kome smo odobrili da razvija nuklearno naoružanje. Reganovci su se pravili kao nisu znali, no naravno da su znali. Cilj je bio da i nadalje obilno financiraju diktaturu. Osim toga, radikalno su poticali „islamizaciju“ pakistanskog društva. Stoga ne samo što su saudijski Arapi najekstremniji radikalni fundamentalisti u svijetu Islama nego su i neka vrsta misionara, a novaca imaju na pretek. Posjeduju isto tako i druge sektore bogatstva, a ogromne novce ulažu u izgradnju džamija, kuranskih škola, i slično, te otuda dolazi veliki broj Talibana. Dakle točno je daje naša uloga u svemu tome velika – ali je i gora od toga. Mislim, pogledajmo zabrinjavajuću povijest koja je nastala nakon ruskog povlačenja. Oni su iza sebe ostavili vladu Najibullaha, koja je po mnogočemu bila prilično razumna. Zapravo, ženama je nakon odlaska Rusa bilo u znatnoj mjeri bolje nego ikada prije, barem u Kabulu i sličnim mjestima. A sama vlada Najibullaha, koja je bila dosta popularna održavala se sve dok se nisu zbila dva događaja. 1) Rusi su se povukli, izvukli, i završava se njihovo pružanje pomoći, i 2) SAD daju podršku mudžahedinima koji su uglavnom religiozni ekstremisti i fundamentalisti – momci koji bacaju kiselinu u oči žena ako nisu propisno odjevene i slično. Oni devastiraju Kabul. Preuzimaju vlast. Bezmalo sve uništavaju. Njihova strahovlada je do te mjere grozna da su svojim dolaskom Talibani dočekani dobrodošlicom."

I do not accept or agree with the actions or views of Hitler or any other dictators in the world for that matter. I do not hate Jews... in fact I have many jewish friends... Hello, although this is technically an unblock appeal, it is really only a reason to explain.... you won't be in a mood to unblock me when I'm finished talking... ) First of all I want to apologise, I should have thought before putting the giant swastika on my page. This is the reason for that... I have a few Jewish friends, and normally we sometimes make jokes about jews and christians and things like that. I never really make jokes about the holocaust, because that never go over well with them and it is not nice... well, apparently, a joke about jews being lawyers set one of my closest friends off who is not really a jew, but claims he is.... now he thinks I am a facist, nazi, and I hate jews.... i gotreally frustrated and annoyed and so I came home and started messing around on my userpage... Second of all, i would like to ask why it is not permissable to ``self identify as a nazi``? There are several userboxes dealing with this subject. There is even a userbox that states, ``This user identifies as a Hitlerist! WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! You will let people say they support Hitler, but you won't let them say they are nazis?!? Being a nazi does not mean that you condone Hitler or his actions, it simple means that you support the theory of the politics behind Nazism.... you can be a nazi and not support the horrible eugenics policy. But if you are hitlerist, that obviously says you support all that... your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews.... well if you are taking that into account, then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist. That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you. They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room. You were then forced to excrete over everyone. You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it. It was alright if you stood perfectly still, but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails. They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up. They would do that for hours on end. Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ... the holocaust was horrible, but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for 18 years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences... so could you ban all communists please?  My last comment is in response to Chzz's question about me making the 'gay comment' statement. Nowadays the word gay is used for two meanings... one is homosexuality and the other is wierd, stupid, dumb... i was using the second connotation.... maybe if you people didn't spend so much time on this gay... sorry... stupid online encyclopedia you would realize how the real world uses words... Even if you unblock me (which you won't... )...) I will take a wikibreak... i don't want to become addicted to point of ruining my social life...... i have already recieved a punishment, never becoming an admin (the whole gay... sorry... dumb trust thing)... just know this... i would have enventually removed the swastika after I cooled down and because of your gay... sorry... dumb policy you have lost a serious editor... this whole thing has really annoyed me...

Fair use rationale for Image:Foxddset.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Foxddset.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any non-free media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

They further considered that not only was Yahweh evil, but Yahweh is the source of all evil, i.e. the devil.

 ==Kilogram and Gene (*sigh*)== 
 I got your message on my talk page. I was baffled as to why  got blocked for a week because I couldn’t immediately find any disruptive behavior after I started looking at his contributions history. Finally, I realized that this choice rant/objection on Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents really snowballed on him—and entirely on autopilot too; he didn’t chime in once after it started snowballing. I didn’t know all that was going on. The Eddie Haskell in me finds some measure of satisfaction in this but the Ward Cleaver in me is really disappointed that the block was due to “lipping off” to administrators that was interpreted as a lack of contrition. Instead, it should have been over the “real” issue: how G*d d*amned disruptive he’s been lately. I remember when I was first working on Thermodynamic temperature and he corrected me numerous times. I remembered him as 1) being intolerant, and 2) always correct. I always figured him as the prototypical sort that is often described as “not suffering fools easily” and tried not to be a fool when he was lurking about. I can see from his block log that most of his offensive behavior has been a rather recent phenomenon. He seems to have changed and that’s too bad. I was truly rather disappointed in him because his way-off-base battle over “weight” didn’t match the Gene I remembered. 

 As for your advise that I should wait “for him to return before going anywhere substantial with the article”, I understand your point and why you felt the need to pass along the caution. I can assure you that I have zero intention to try to take advantage of the situation. I noticed this allegation by an administrator on “The Gene topic” on Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard that I “baited Gene.” I was tempted to object to that in an open forum and then thought the better of it given what happened to Gene. But that administrator’s allegation is 100%, industrial-strength “El toro poo poo” (Bol mierda). The only edits I make are good-faith ones. Period. I did note that after I made an edit, Gene reverted it here along with the threat that “…if Greg L insists on changing this, """"dubious"""" tag goes back on.”  Of course, I waited until Gene was no longer blocked before making any changes and was frankly surprised that Gene would have objected to that particular one because the difference was over a subtlety and was factually unassailable. But after he objected to it—and even after he threatened to again slap the article with {{disputed}} tags, one can’t cave in the face of “Wiki-terrorism” threats; he really went overboard with that comment so I simply ignored it. Gene obviously had sufficient judgment to not carry through with the threat. Those three edits are what I think the administrator may have tarred and feathered with his “bait” allegation. I understand it would be highly inappropriate to purposely exploit the current situation (Gene being blocked for a week). I also know that at some point, I have to treat the whole “Gene thing” as just another bug splat on my windshield of life and get on with doing the right thing: making good-faith edits and having fun as a volunteer on a collaborative writing phenomenon. But I’ll also be careful to not do any edits that might be interpreted as intentionally provocative.

0,"Answer: You use the date July 20 of 1599 AD as Thot 1 and retreat one date back every 4 years, or 30 days back in 120 years. Example, 240 years is 60 days back to May 21 of 1839 AD, or Apr 21 of 1959 AD, then add 13 days in our 1900 or 2000 century to have Gregorian May 4 in 1959 AD. Another 44 years to 2003 AD and 11 leap days takes all the dates back to April 23. Then 2004-2007 is April 22. In reply to the post below which says the Coptic calendar is not Egyptian, the answer is our September 11 as Thot 1 is Julian August 29. Though the Coptic calendar (Egyptian with leap days) was accepted in 284 AD (which Era of Diocletion is the Era of Christian Martyrs so coincidentally the year 6000 of Adam in the Jewish book of Josephus published in Rome), this calendar leap day was created in 27 BC by Augustus Octavius Caesar who inaugurated it in 25 BC when Thoht 1 becomes August 29. Therefore, the Coptic calendar is Julian (not Gregorian). Events against America have been on Egyptian dates. The August 2 invasion of Kuwait is Julian July 20 and the invasion takes place at 30 degrees where the rise of Sothis occurs on that date only at that latitude; this implying Saddam chose the rise to invade. However, they felt world trade controlling oil was USA blame. Another date is Thoth 1 was Feb 26 in 747 BC. In 1993 the world trade was bombed on Gregorian Feb 26 not taking into account that Julian Feb 26 is March 11 (March 10 in leap year). The Coptic calendar honors this date as the half year placing Pamenot 1 on March 10 and the internet terrorists attempt to destroy world trade by constantly revising the March 10 virus."

The infobox provides the user with the time, place, sides, major generals, etc.... while the navigational template provides all the other information that the infobox cannot provide. Sound good?"

 Hi Peter, I'll look into this bug shortly. I will run a trace of your classifications and see if, indeed, some of the revisions do show up twice. This is pretty core functionality for something to go wrong and unnoticed for so long  although maybe it is specific to the WikiTrust queue  which does not see a lot of use. This is the user-name you were using? And you logged in with the same user-name both times, right?
 Can you describe what the scrolling issue is? I fret this could be a tougher fix  its not like I actually implement scrolling, this is just something Java provides. 
 Also, you'll generally find that the accuracy of classifications among the queues looks like """"Cluebot-NG > STiki > WikiTrust"""" (assuming everything is working correctly). This is of course, is dependent on a complex set of criteria, how many people have been using a particular queue lately, etc.

0,"`::::But.. Wikipedia is wisdom of the crowd. See this aricle:  :::::For Kendall Whitehouse, senior director of information technology at Wharton, the most interesting question is ``whether the wisdom of the crowd is ultimately a better approach compared to scholarly review and edited content.`` As Whitehouse observes, ``Wikipedia's strength is that it has thousands of eyes looking at it. The hope is that errors will be quickly caught and corrected.``.. Marketing professor Peter Fader notes that Wikipedia shows there is wisdom in crowds, but a better user rating system would filter out those who post bogus information. Joel Waldfogel, professor of business and public policy, agrees that much of the concern about Wikipedia is just a new spin on whether old media (printed encyclopedias, in this case) stand a chance against the new breed of instantly updatable online media. (quoted from article). In short, no matter what system you come up with here, it is going to be wisdom of the crowd, by design, that is what Wiki is. So you might as well design a system around that concept, go with the natural design of the system, work with it to all its advantages, not work against it and try to limit it with ``old media`` concepts.    `"

0,"  I've removed the section, which was totally weird.  The problems listed seem to be completely random.  We don't even know the order of kings or have any idea of the length of their reigns for centuries of Egyptian history.  Even for dynasties we know well, like the 18th, there's no fully agreed upon chronology.  Relationships among monarchs are frequently not known.  Over all, it would probably take far less time to say what we do know about the pharaohs than what we don't, because we barely know anything at all about even a well known pharaoh like Ramesses II, as compared to, say, a modern figure of comparable importance and longevity like Louis XIV. The list given was completely arbitrary, and gave no idea why these problems, out of all the huge number of things we don't know, were being listed on the main Pharaoh page.  I think it's best for it to not be here.  "

It's better to simply refer to the disagreement in the legal, academic, and political communities during that period. ::::::Also, McDonald did not overrule any Supreme Court decisions. Only Justice Thomas would have done so. The plurality opinion distinguished those earlier decisions (e.g., Cruikshank) on the ground that those decisions ruled that the Second Amendment was not incorporated via the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but did not discuss the Due Process Clause. The plurality ruled that those decisions were not precedent for whether the Second Amendment could be incorporated via the Due Process Clause. The plurality opinion is the de facto Opinion of the Court, because it is the opinion that supports the holding and is based on the narrowest grounds (see Marks v. United States).   "

Linguistics/archaeology claims there is just one true 'word' a ssuch which is 'sign'.  There are multiple words if Australia's Indigneous language is considered.  because this language has been mostly separated from what it refers to (cultere) the archs/linguists then think they can take possession.  Its like the rock art battles where some archs claim they must be preserved because current day Indigneosu people are painting over them, (a cultural practice as part of ongoing culture).

0,  I don't understand post signing but I think note 117 ending the section on Justice Verma Commission is very misleading. The findings appear to have been completely sidelined as the women's groups in India maintain. The Finance Minister former Union Sec P Chidambaram openly stated that the cabinet cannot push through the reforms suggested by the Verma Report on AFSPA reform for example because the Army will not allow it. The rushed through new anti-rape ordinances ask for things not found in Verma. Simple directives for medical practitioners to stop the two finger test (it would be called finger fucking in the west but someone will object to the term not the procedure) and then call them forensic reports must be stopped as they are illegal. I accept the Cabinet are making positive noises about it though they are unlikely to accept any of Justice Verma's proposals or adopt the spirit of his reforms ie demanding equal respect for women from low castes tribals and minority indian communities. i am adding four tildas now but I presume that's wrong desmond coutinho

 """"There are no references to urban settlement on the site for the better part of a millennium thereafter"""" (Brubaker et al. 2006, p.89) (  ) 
 :A few observations: 
 :# Just because Mr. Brubaker doesn't know about any, it doesn't mean that there are none or that there won't be any ever found. I guess this topic has to be expanded anyway as it has only one view (WP:NPOV). Even if it was theoretical gap of one millennium, which to me defines logic and common sense given the city is in the middle of Europe and on the path of migrations, and there was no known asteroid, volcano eruption or ice age in that period. It was a simple conquest by others, which happen throughout the history all the time. The native population was wiped out, assimilated, enslaved, dominated (most likely in my opinion), whatever. But it doesn't make sense to assume a waste land for 1000 years, after a significant ancient history and with so many invaders. 
 :# The Dacian and Roman ruins and artifacts are in the middle of the medieval city and not 50 km away as in other situations. Even if there are speculations that the native Daco-Roman population disappeared or was wiped out by the new invaders, the new comers obviously built their """"new"""" town exactly on top of the ruined ancient city. They even probably named it after the Castrum Clus/clausa as described in the etymology, thus they insured continuity and created a clear link to the ancient city. Napoca was under new management. Why they didn't call it Napoca anymore? There are many possibilities, one being a desire to impose a new culture, to erase previous history. 
 :# Having the Napoca name appended back to Cluj, is questionable and debatable, can be deemed political or protochronistic, but at the end of the day, not entirely unfair, as the city obviously has a very significant and rich ancient history that happen exactly in the same place where the medieval Cluj was. The municipium is depicted as a major city on Tabula Peutingeriana section of Roman Dacia, on equal footing with Apula, Axiopolis, Ratiaria, Serdica and this speaks about the importance, size etc. So the ancient history part of the city deserves it equal share on an encyclopedic article like this. Cluj-Napoca is obviously not just a medieval city. 
 :# The section on ancient history also doesn't mentions the Celtic presence at all. See also Celts in Transylvania and also the National Museum of Transylvanian History. Nothing about rich archaeological finds either. A lot of content is missing and deserves its place here.

I understand that you were consolidating references since just one is used for most paragraphs. However, per WP:V ``material challenged or likely to be challenged, and all quotations, must be attributed``. Therefore I think it's better to have a generous amount rather than just one per paragraph. Moreover, if someone was to add information to the article from another source it could wrongly appear that all the information in the paragraph before the reference comes from the new source (unless of course the editor was careful to duplicate sources).

 Gerry Ouellette 

Hi there, I took a look at the article and it appears that the references you added are there now. I cleaned up some of the text and added a number of wikilinks, and fixed the year of his first Hardy Cup win which was in 1972 not 1971. I read both of the sources you used, and just so you know, blogs are usually not considered reliable sources. I have seen that particular blog used in other articles so I will leave it, but don't be surprised if it gets removed by someone else. Also, the two sources appear to contradict each other. One states he played for the 1972 Hardy Cup winners, the other states he was only the coach, while the article for Campbellton, New Brunswick mentions he was both a player and the coach. 

You mentioned on my talk page that """"Unfortunately, the info contained in the link for """"Gerry Ouellette"""" is pretty sparse"""", and also that """"He is a local hero in Grand Falls, N.B., and deserves to be recognized"""". While this all may be true, being a """"local hero"""" doesn't me that the person """"deserves"""" to have a Wikipedia article. Having a Wikipedia article is going to based on notability, and being a """"local hero"""" may make someone notable to you or others in the community, it's not going to make the person notable to the general population. We can only write an article based on the info that's out there on the person, and looking at those two sources, there's not a whole lot provided. I mean no disrespect when I say this, but it should be pretty obvious that a subject who played just 34 games in the NHL, the rest in the minors and senior hockey isn't going to be all that notable, which is why there isn't a long detailed article that others have.

0,"` January 2007 (UTC) *Francis, Of course I am open to the consensus of the group (any actual trads involved?).  However, I think your argument is misplaced. Mainstream Roman Catholicism at this time includes a broad cross-section of people with a wide variety of commitment levels, and yet all are considered ``Catholic``, so I do not think that one can simply compare trads in general with a subset of mainstream Catholics, which we might, for convenience, term ``hardcore.``  In any event, my vision for this article in general, and for this section in particular, is to present an accurate picture of the persons discussed, who are traditional, or traditionalist Catholics.  Given that, it obvious that some things which are identified with them, such as praying the Rosary frequently or going to Confession often, will also be found among some, more commited, more devout mainstream Catholics.  To address your concerns, I am open to acknowledging in the article that this overlap exists.  However, I think that removing any reference in this article, in this section, to recitation of the Rosary is selling both somewhat short.  There are other things, as well, which could be added, such as a preference for homeschooling (which, again, would not be confined to trads, or even Catholics, but which, I would think, would correlate highly with a traditionalist position.  However, the question of the Rosary sort of gets to the heart of the matter.   00:22, 11`"

The other plank is when and where he practiced. The subjects of his photographs, the people, their clothes, their floating and their static palaces etc. etc. is what is notable.  This collection is a unique, historical, visual record of a long dead era. It is not just a collection of photos of old boats. Kirk was uniquely positioned to photograph a distillation of an aspect of society. That aspect of society existed here and there, now and then, throughout this and other countries. But it came together for a short period each year at Cowes in what I have called a distillation. He did photograph it and his work has remained together, its existence, until recently, known only to a small group.  :::The trustees of the two collections feel, I am sure, that the photographs are too valuable to be published willy nilly on the internet.  In any event that would be impractical and was not my intention. My plan had been to try to make the collection's scope known. Not as an advertisment but as a dissemination of information.  :::As an analogy consider the article about a national collection described in page 10 of today's Guardian.

I had just typed out a smashing long post, then accidentally closed my browser tab...so I will save the civility protests and long explanations for another day.  Your proposed addition is mostly okay, and gives a good treatment to the question of how the word """"terrorist"""" is applied to the organization.  I would add the FBI website, and the fact that it was one of the organizations on the FBI's terrorism task force watch list.  There are plenty of categories, too many probably, available to help direct readers interested in the topic of terrorism to this article.  Category:Terrorism in America is one of them; the one you just added (:Category:Organizations designated as terrorist by the U.S. government) is another.  There is a huge BLP concern with branding living ex members as terrorists, particularly unconvicted ones who deny the charge.

0,"`30, 29 August 2013 (UTC)  == Your comment ==  Your comment- Well, quite frankly, not everyone subscribes to that notion, and it is quite wrong of you and a handful of others to push your ideology onto people who hold a different opinion on the matter. There is simply no actual person named ``Chelsea Manning`` here. What we have is a man named ``Bradley Manning`` who wants to be called by this other name (and awhile ago it was reportedly ``Breanna``) and referred to as ``she``. That is all. That is the reality that the article should reflect, the policy of WP:COMMONNAME. Bradley Manning was a solider in the United States military. Bradley Manning was caught passing classified intel to unauthorized parties, convicted, and sentenced. After that, Bradley Manning decided to be called ``Chelsea``. That is how the flow of the article should be, these are all things that a man named Bradley Manning did, you can't just flick a switch and rewrite history to say ``Chelsea Manning was convicted of violating the Espionage Act...`` and so on. That just isn't historically accurate or truthful. When and if he legally changes his name, that is when the transition process of the article should begin. That all was simply way too soon.  I want you to know that I agree with you 100%. Your comment was one of, if not the best on the talk page. I just wanted to let you know.     :Thanks. )   12:`"

0,"`I had nearly moved on when I felt completely compelled to comment on this statement ``probably better than most clan websites, which tend to be based on long outdated stuff from the 19th century. Then I do not see a problem in using it until a better source can be found. Especially to make amends to the masses of unsourced information that is found on so many of the individual clan articles``. I can only interpet this as something is probably better because it is newer?? This makes no sense to me. History is what it is, it should not change for the sake of change. If it was accurate over 600 years ago, it is just as accurate today. Again, if something is true and accurate hundreds or even thousands of years ago, it is not and should not be subject to change because someone decides to re-write it for either personal gain or an agenda. That is exactly what has happened with the origins for many Highland Clans. For any that might be interested, William Skene's and John Murray's collaboration of The Highlanders of Scotland: Their Origin, History and Antiquities is a wonderful and refreshing read. This is more than likely the truest accounting for several of the Highland Clans. It asserts that many of the origin claims put forth in more recent times are attempts to gain a foothold on the Chieftainship, by usurping the rightful lines. You'll find that cadet septs used this technique to basically try to re-write history for their own selfish gain. You'd have to read the book to see how this played out but as I said before, nearly ALL of the Highland Clans being ``bastardized`` as Norman/Anglo-Horman/Flemish, etc. are really Dalriadan and Pictish mixes. Examples would be Campbell, Cameron, Grant, Davidson, Wallace, etc. I of course have distant YDNA connections to ALL of these surnames, but I know no one wants to hear about that as any sort of evidence. I'll admit not one of these surnames or clans has a pure lineage, but they all have a lineage going back to the Picts and Gaels. I am of that lineage, which is quite rare and continues to be established. The masses are not of that lineage, they are a mix if R1A1, other R1B haplotypes, the I haplotypes, etc. I will be the first to admit there may be hundreds of families, not even related through a shared male ancestor, sharing a surname or Clan. My concern is with the origins only, and the original Chiefly lines. And please don't tell me how we are a mix of so much dna, I am only referring to YDNA, the male lines. I am not talking about MTDNA nor Autosomal. What I don't understand is why when there is so much sourced information out there, some editors choose only to use factually inaccurate ``sourced`` information. There is substantial ``factually accurate`` sourced information out there however it is not my intent, to correct these erroneous articles or to present an ``opposing view``. There is no opposing view, there is either the truth, or their are lies. Either the Celtic version is correct, or the Comyn version is correct, or neither is correct. There can't factually be multiple versions of an origin, it is what it is and there is only one true origin. This is not a contest to see who can provide more recent sources. I would hope wikipedia would want the truth out there, and not contests of who can out edit who, which is what wikipedia appears to be. There, my case is presented to the message and not a specific messenger. Clan Davidson is Celtic, it descended from Celts and it has no connection to the Comyn family. It did not descend from a Comyn male. They came from a very ancient Gaelic ancestor, an ancestor shared by several Highland Clans, before surnames even were in use. One other greatly incorrect update to this site was the battle alleged between the Davidson's and the MacPherson's....this never happened. The battle was between the Clans fighting for the Chief of the Clan Chattan, the battle was fought between the Mackintoshs and the MacPhersons.The MacPhersons were the true chiefly line, but were ``out-documented`` by the usurping Mackintosh. This is pretty much exactly what is happening here, on this very page. I hope someone else has more time and energy to properly update this page with the correct information and let's bury the lies and factually inaccurate information comprising most of this article. It was originally much more factually accurate, but over the course of time has been corrupted with sourced information that is not also factually accurate.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`"

0,"`The following lists the chain of events which led to the inclusion of entities which are not countries to the list. I suppose it takes some detective work to come up with this, although it isnt really that difficult. I leave it up to you guys to interpret the intentions behind this sequence of events:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===The old version===NEWLINE_TOKENAs seen in the version timestamped 07:25, 7 Jan 2005 in this page's edit history, the page listed only countries (as commonly accepted to refer to fully independent entities as recognised by the UN), with an opening line which reads:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``This is a list of countries that only have a land border with one other country.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Carbon copy created===NEWLINE_TOKENOn 01:21, 4 Feb 2005, a similarly titled page called List of countries bordering only one country was created by a user named . In the first version of that page, the opening line reads:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``This is a list of countries and dependent territories having land border with only one country.NEWLINE_TOKENNotes:NEWLINE_TOKENThis list includes dependent territories and some disputed or occupied areas that are de facto independent.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENInterestingly, that first version includes Hong Kong and Macau as the only two non-independent entities, while Singapore was listed under a classification called ``Arguable``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Merger?===NEWLINE_TOKENWithin a few hours, the page has evolved to this version at 03:13, 4 Feb 2005. Notably, he copied the introductory text from the first article into his version of the article:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Nations that only share a land border with one other country often have concerns about domination by the other state if it is larger. These can be fears of an outright take-over as has happened historically to such states as East Timor, which was part of Indonesia until very recently, and Ireland, which was part of the United Kingdom until 1921. Today concerns are often about economic domination as with the Canada/United States relationship or the Denmark/Germany one. Because much trade goes over land these countries are often heavily reliant on their single neighbour.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn addition, he added the ``merge`` request with the above page within the same edit.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBack in this page, he also added the ``merge`` request at 03:11, 4 Feb 2005NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Merged===NEWLINE_TOKENBy 18:57, 7 Feb 2005,  fulfilled the merger request. This effectively places 's introductory paragraph concerning non-independent entities, as well as his entries for these, into that list as can be seen in edit version 19:01, 7 Feb 2005, without  probably suspecting anything unusual.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Contestations===NEWLINE_TOKENSince this merger, debates over the inclusion of entities which are not countries ensued, unsurprisingly, as we can see above and in the history of edits. It is interesting that  made no mention about the merger process which sparked this discourse. In addition, as we can all see from the above discussions,  was quoted as saying:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``They aren't sovereign states, but the same treatment should applies to all lists of countries with the same setting. The notice at the top of the page already tells this list includes not only sovereign states, without any confusions.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt has to be noted, that again he did not mention who was the one who wrote that paragraph, and nor did he mention how it ends up being introduced to this page.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Deductions and comments?===NEWLINE_TOKENThe chain of events as I noted ends here. Feel free to comment on the above conduct. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`"

If he already publishes a newspaper in multiple languages, presumably he has sufficient number of translators on board. The site did mention that there were a number of translations of the ``Poisonous Mushroom`` were currently being worked on. At the very least there is an English translation and obviously the original German version. As there is an Estonian translation, then likely there would be a Finnish one too, and Russian as well if this translator is over 40. Being the USA, I don't think a Spanish version would be difficult to come by. Seems to me the reason that the Estonian version is highlighted on this site was because of the fact that it had drawn the attention of the Estonian Police, not because it was uniquely available in the Estonian language as implied by the Wikipedia article.  `"

Yes it definitely isn't an ideal source, but unfortunately since these events took place in a very secretive, distant battlefield (Mike Spann was the first US casualty in the War in Afghanistan), the fine details of the event are limited to only a few sources, thankfully an experienced and respected English-speaking journalist was there shortly after events to record them. And yes unfortunately I know way more about this subject than I ever intended to. There were MANY previous edit wars, although I say more towards vandalism, which were mainly just people reverting edits on bias (same types of information  anything negative towards Lindh  was only thing removed) and saying the cites weren't right and making me have to go through sometimes hundreds of pages of documents (like the AR15 field investigation) and find the page number, paragraph, and line for them to prove the integrity of the cite to get them to stop.

 The issue originally was the word change, which I imagined would be entirely uncontroversial.  A separate issue then became the attacks on me from all sides led by Dave1185, to which I responded angrily.  My anger has then been used to justify the original attacks.  The issue here is still the word change.  The other issue, you can discuss elsewhere if you like.  On the word change, it still seems very simple to me.  Slavishly adopting the wording of the source is wrong.  The word """"said"""" is entirely neutral, while the word """"explained"""" carries connotations that the article should not be carrying.  It doesn't matter at all if the source said """"explained"""".  Insisting that a word must be used because it appears in the original source makes a complete mockery of the concept of writing an encyclopaedia. The aim here is a bit higher than a massive copy and paste exercise, is it not?  Anyway, it seems to me from the source that Lee did not """"explain"""" or """"say"""" but the Singapore government did.  So, where it says """"Lee explained..."""" it could say """"The Singapore government said..."""".  This is accurate and neutral.
 Incidentally I think the protection of this article is a disgrace, and looks to have been done simply to gain the upper hand in this strange dispute.  There is no """"persistent sockpuppetry"""". 2.220.204.70  """

However, the he said / she said statements regarding religious references in the ``Star Trek`` universe are probably inappropriate here, in Roddenberry's biography. Is not such discussion better placed in entries regarding ``Star Trek?``     ``I guess from that time it was clear to me that religion was largely nonsense, was largely magical, superstitious things. In my own teen life I just couldn't see any point in adopting something based on magic, which was obviously phony and superstitious. I stopped going to church as soon as it became possible to do things on my own as a teenager. I made up my mind that church, and probably largely the Bible, was not for me. I did not go back to even thinking much about it. If people need to do that, ignore them and maybe they will ignore you and you can go on with your own life. (Alexander,  Star Trek Creator, p. 37)  ``My second wife Majel Lee (Hudec) and I were both raised Protestant but well before ever meeting had both left the Protestant Church in favor of non-sectarian beliefs which included respect for all other religions, but emphasizing the concept of God as too great and too encompassing to be explained and appreciated by any single system of belief. Some aspects of Buddhism express some of our beliefs but also do some aspects of the New and Old Testaments as well as other books and philosophies.`` (Alexander, Star Trek Creator, p. 422).  ``It seems to me more and more with each passing year and each new massacre (as many perpetrated by Christians as anyone else) that the real villain is religion - at least religion as generally practiced by people who somehow become sure that they and only they know the 'real' answer. How few humans there are that seem to realize that killing, much less hating, their fellow humans in the name of their 'god' is the ultimate kind of perversion.  At any rate, I've elected to believe in a God which is so far beyond our conception and real understanding that it would be nonsense to do anything in its name other than perhaps to revere all life as being part of that unfathomable greatness.`` (Alexander, Star Trek Creator, p. 480)  Alexander, David.

August 2, 2006   Trekker1 here... I worked on the show and with Gene Roddenberry.  He did not leave the show in the third season.  He worked right up until his death.  And why post mean-spirited things about arguements with the studio?  Is this really what should be in a biography?  I'm not sure how to get into this chat room  hope this is the way.  I will continue to monitor his bio for accuracy and appropriate commentary.  :Wikipedia is not meant to be mean. We try to collect ``facts`` on a neutrale point of view. There are a lot of sources that say that Gene was quite controversial. e.g.: http://www.talkingpix.co.uk/Books_Gene%20Roddenberry.html or just read the autobiographies of Kirk, Spock, Uhura....

0,"Topics for Revising Gravity article 

What was challenging? 
For film's that propose questions about reality and controversy- an opportunity is deemed by users to not only post information about the film/actors/production, etc, but also to discuss themes present in the movie. Drifting away from that note, the article itself meets the standards to being a good article. There are little to none spelling errors, and information is almost spot-on with the right dates, people, and nomination facts. But that may be the overall problem of this article...is it too much factual based? Are people necessarily not focused on the article itself but rather the movie? In order to improve not only the article but the revisions to the essay, I will focus on how the film can compare to previous NASA space missions.
Possible Topics for Article Gravity (Film):

Factual Errors/ Scientific Accuracy
-Stars do not twinkle in the realms of space. If you are located on the earth’s surface, you might witness the twinkling of stars because of the earth’s atmosphere. 
-When Kowalski and Stone are stuck between cords in a spacecraft, Kowalski orders to be let go of and is then sent through space, floating away with decreasing oxygen levels. This is incorrect because both are in the same orbit, so a small tug would have worked to pull Kowalski toward safety. 
- When Dr. Stone gets back into the spacecraft, she initially takes off her spacesuit. Two parts are missing: Liquid Cooling & Ventilation Garment. In the film, Stone goes through an extreme amount of stress and excitement, leaving her to be awfully sweaty underneath her spacesuit. However, as she takes it off, there are no signs of sweat, which does not make sense.

 ==Example of Wikipropaganda== 

 This column was written by Lawrence Solomon. 

 Ever wonder how Al Gore, the United Nations, and company continue to get away with their claim of a """"scientific consensus"""" confirming their doomsday view of global warming? Look no farther than Wikipedia for a stunning example of how the global-warming propaganda machine works. 

 As you (or your kids) probably know, Wikipedia is now the most widely used and influential reference source on the Internet and therefore in the world, with more than 50 million unique visitors a month. 

 In theory Wikipedia is a """"people's encyclopedia"""" written and edited by the people who read it - anyone with an Internet connection. So on controversial topics, one might expect to see a broad range of opinion. 

 Not on global warming. On global warming we get consensus, Gore-style: a consensus forged by censorship, intimidation, and deceit.  

 I first noticed this when I entered a correction to a Wikipedia page on the work of Naomi Oreskes, author of the now-infamous paper, published in the prestigious journal Science, claiming to have exhaustively reviewed the scientific literature and found not one single article dissenting from the alarmist version of global warming.  

 Of course Oreskes's conclusions were absurd, and have been widely ridiculed. I myself have profiled dozens of truly world-eminent scientists whose work casts doubt on the Gore-U.N. version of global warming. Following the references in my book The Deniers, one can find hundreds of refereed papers that cast doubt on some aspect of the Gore/U.N. case, and that only scratches the surface. 

 Naturally I was surprised to read on Wikipedia that Oreskes's work had been vindicated and that, for instance, one of her most thorough critics, British scientist and publisher Bennie Peiser, not only had been discredited but had grudgingly conceded Oreskes was right.  

 I checked with Peiser, who said he had done no such thing. I then corrected the Wikipedia entry, and advised Peiser that I had done so. 

 Peiser wrote back saying he couldn't see my corrections on the Wikipedia page. I made the changes again, and this time confirmed that the changes had been saved. But then, in a twinkle, they were gone again. I made other changes. And others. They all disappeared shortly after they were made.  

 Turns out that on Wikipedia some folks are more equal than others. Kim Dabelstein Petersen is a Wikipedia """"editor"""" who seems to devote a large part of his life to editing reams and reams of Wikipedia pages to pump the assertions of global-warming alarmists and deprecate or make disappear the arguments of skeptics.  

 I soon found others who had the same experience: They would try to squeeze in any dissent, or even correct an obvious slander against a dissenter, and Petersen or some other censor would immediately snuff them out. 

 Now Petersen is merely a Wikipedia """"editor."""" Holding the far more prestigious and powerful position of """"administrator"""" is William Connolley. Connolley is a software engineer and sometime climatologist (he used to hold a job in the British Antarctic Survey), as well as a serial (but so far unsuccessful) office seeker for England's Green party. 

 And yet by virtue of his power at Wikipedia, Connolley, a ruthless enforcer of the doomsday consensus, may be the world's most influential person in the global warming debate after Al Gore. Connolley routinely uses his editorial clout to tear down scientists of great accomplishment such as Fred Singer, the first director of the U.S. National Weather Satellite Service and a scientist with dazzling achievements. Under Connolley's supervision, Wikipedia relentlessly smears Singer as a kook who believes in Martians and a hack in the pay of the oil industry.  

 Wikipedia is full of rules that editors are supposed to follow, and it has a code of civility. Those rules and codes don't apply to Connolley, or to those he favors.  

 """"Peisers crap shouldn't be in here,"""" Connolley wrote several weeks ago, in berating a Wikipedian colleague during an """"edit war,"""" as they're called. Trumping Wikipedia's stated rules, Connelly used his authority to ensure Wikipedia readers saw only what he wanted them to see. Any reference, anywhere among Wikipedia's 2.5 million English-language pages, that casts doubt on the consequences of climate change will be bent to Connolley's bidding. 

 Nor are Wikipedia's ideological biases limited to global warming. As an environmentalist I find myself with allies and adversaries on both sides of the aisle, Left and Right. But there is no doubt where Wikipedia stands: firmly on the Left. Try out Wikipedia's entries on say, Roe v. Wade or Intel"

0,"Proposed Section Additions  

 I would like to suggest adding two new sections. In this post I will first detail these sections, and then explain how I think they will improve the article. The first new section would be a high level overview of the current IBM, similar to or even drawn from the intro on the main IBM article.  This section will provide the reader with a sense of what the end point is for the evolutionary story told by the remainder of the article. 

 The second new section will in effect become a New Timeline. It will consist of a chronological bullet list of significant developments in the company's history - products, technologies, people, corporate and organizational events. It will be factual, not promotional. I will be happy to provide the initial content for this section. DISCLAIMER: I am Paul Lasewicz, IBM's Corporate Archivist (see my user page). I understand and fully support the reader's and editor's right to be suspicious of any and all content I provide. For my part, I will strive to make this content factual and objective. But I recognize that there will be those who may feel it is still not neutral enough for this purpose, and I would look to those folks for additions and language edits in order to keep make sure the article is in keeping with Wikipedia's policies. 

 The current section Old Timeline content, which by its narrative format lends itself to a more interpretive, thematic function, would become a new section 3. It would retain its focus on linking events and developments in order to help the readers better understand the broad sweeps of the evolutionary path the company has followed. It would have to be renamed, perhaps something like 'Major Themes'? Similarly, the current section 2 (Major events et al) would become section 4, and retain its utility as a place to capture aspects of the company's history that require deeper dives. See also, Further reading, and References would then become sections 5, 6, and 7. 

 The benefits that I see in adding this content and shuffling the current organization of the article are multiple. First, the addition of bulleted content will authoritatively enhance the depth and breadth of company historical information presented by the article. It will give the reader a fuller, more accurate account of the scope IBM's activities over nearly a century of being in business.  

 The second benefit is that it will provide raw material for fleshing out the more narrative, thematic aspects of the article. This fleshing out is, I feel, necessary, because one of the few critiques I have of this article is that the narrative sections tend to be a little uneven. No doubt due to the participation of multiple authors and editors - each who has diverse and different areas of expertise - the current timeline and major events sections can be shallow in some places and too granular in others. This additional material will, when incorporated via future edits, serve to fill in gaps in those narratives. Anything we can do to smooth that uneveness out will enhance the accuracy of the article, and increase its value to the reader. 

 Lastly, these proposed changes will make editing and maintaining this page less troublesome. IBM can be a polarizing institution - it's a profitable corporation that has in the past and continues to deal with world changing technologies and engages with domestic and foreign governments and businesses. Each of these aspects can be a touchstone for strong feelings. By presenting much of that sometimes polarizing content in brief, bulleted snippets, the article will better and more easily maintain a NPOV. Hopefully, this unbiased, factual manner will minimize subjective word choice and (hopefully) help mitigate, if not actually avoid, controversy for the readers/editors.

1,"  == Abuse of 'authority' == Not to burst your petty little power trip, but it isn't exactly fair game to ban someone just because he was right and you were proven wrong. When someone accuses another of being an 'anti-semite' just because the ADL has labelled him as such, I want to point out to to the Wikipedia audience that however horrible it may be, 'anti-semitism' actually originated from the United States, not Nazi-Germany, though it later adopted it from the likes of Madison Grant and Charles Davenport. Wikipedia's own article on Henry Ford states as much, yet when I bring it up in a Talk section, I get accused by the likes of you for vandalism and banned.  It is the sheer height of hypocrisy that you can go around calling people like me a 'crank' and 'conspiracy theorist', yet I get BANNED by you just because I call you a 'deceptive little creature', which you clearly have demonstrated you are. You can CALL ME all sorts of names, yet I in return am not allowed that privilege. You are deliberately colluding with THF and Collect (two other sockpuppets on Prescott Bush's page) to get rid of as much 'inconvenient' information as possible. Perhaps it's just because you're really clueless and really don't know alot - that would be at least the half-way respectable scenario, and the least weighing on your conscience.  You want your audience (who I presume you want to delude, that is, unless you really DID NOT KNOW Henry Ford published The Elders Of Zion) to remain in a paradigm - without ever knowing where anti-semitism originated from and what a joke it is to see the ones who PROMOTED the concept of 'racial purity' and 'Aryan superiority' to Hitler to remain free of persecution. You use that 'ploy', that 'slogan', 'anti-semite', 'crank', as a silencing technique. It's a deceptive con-game, especially when you never get at the heart of the matter - where the anti-semitism came from, who started the ball rolling, and hey, guess what? The source of origin is a very unlikely one, and very unfortunate and inconvenient indeed for the self-righteous Americans always eager to trot out charges of 'anti-semitism'.  Unfortunately for you, and your sources, Prescott Bush's collusion with the Nazis is a well-established fact, and is well-documented in numerous high-profile books on the subject, including Trading With The Enemy: An Expose of the Nazi-American Money Plot. What you have constructed thus far are 'strawmen' arguments and falling back on 'guilt by association'. You peddle establishment sources as the ultimate harbinger of truth, perhaps KNOWING or NOT KNOWING the complete collusion of mainstream news with the establishment. More unfortunate for you, still, is that President Calvin Coolidge, Woodrow Wilson, Margaret Sanger, the father of JFK and countless other Americans clearly believed in the Nordic/Aryan races' superiority and viewed the Nazis as good. Worse still is that FDR refused to take Jewish refugees from Nazi-Germany. Even worse, university professors were making statements in 1936 to the tune of 'Hitler is beating us at our own game - race hygiene and sterilization'. This is all documented in books such as Edwin Black's 'War Against The Weak' - and don't come with your silly, puny little slogan such as 'conspiracy theorist' just because you don't care and don't want to know.  Unlike you and your petty insults and one-liners, I can back up all these claims with facts and more. I can only conclude that you're a weak-minded yuppie who really does not CARE about the facts, but whether or not you can hang out with your equally deceptive Wikipedians, gain some 'street' credits and keep people in a deceitful paradigm while slandering people who want to break out of your make-believe reality. And of course, being an American, you want to uphold this concocted, grand noble myth that you're the good guys and you fought Nazism. I can only tell you haven't looked into the eugenics history of your own country, or the Royal Institute of Intl. Affairs Conference of 1938. You didn't read Edwin Black's War Against The Weak, haven't you? You haven't read Eugenics And Other Evils by Chesterton, huh?  We live in the information age, sonny. Ignorance is no veil to hide behind - and neither are petty and childish retorts like 'crank', 'anti-semite' or 'conspiracy theorists'. So lose that beard of yours and that smug grin (BTW, not to hurt your ego, but you don't look all that great), quit being so gullible, because I have a newsflash for you, if you keep sticking your head in the sand, you're gonna get hurt real bad too, bubba - by your own masters. The only thing you're doing is discrediting Wikipedia even further by engaging in clear deception.  And if it serves your power trip, go ahead, ban me again. Do what thou wilt. Do your worst, 'bubba'. Show me your power!!!! (ROFLMAO) Your Internet is gonna get shut down soon, bubba, replaced by Internet2, and given the futures market, Jimmy Wales the Wall Street hustler is not going to be there to give it another tug - so there goes your admin privileges. Just know that I don't grovel to the likes of you - I don't bow down and I do not let myself get silenced just because some deluded individual has familiarized himself with a 'slogan' that is somehow intended to put me down. OK, bubba?  "

In the index, and on a brief flip through there is no mention of satan, satanic abuse, ritual abuse, the United States, religion, religious leaders, the satanic panic, courts, judicial systems, guilt, or anything else that really supports the sentence ``In America and Britain journalists framed the charges against the defendants as evidence of a moral panic and mass hysteria; child protection workers and social workers involved were bound by their professional codes of confidentiality and unable to comment on the specifics of the cases``  There is focus on two cases - Cleveland and Orkney, both in the UK.  Based on my reading, the main focus of the book is on how the media's portrayal of the cases affected the public's perception of the event years later - not on guilt or innocence (though there is discussion on how the media left out and selectively reported details that were more convincing of the guilt of the parents.  If anyone on this talk page has read the book or is responsible for placing the text on the page, could you refer me to the page number (and chapter in case we have different versions) so I can verify?  Right now I'm tempted to excise the statement for having a) nothing to do with the U.S. b) nothing to do with the outcome of court cases and c) nothing to do with satanic ritual abuse.  If nothing else, it would allow the most nuanced, hopefully most neutral, portrayal of the book's contents.  Kitzinger appears to be very carefully saying nothing about the suspects' guilt or innocence, but I admit it is a cursory flip-through.  Got some other scholarly books from the same section in the library, some of which discuss SRA specifically, hopefully I'll find time to read them.    `"

0,", 15 September 2005 (UTC)  :It is essential that the Able Danger debate be carried out in the places where it is relevant.  It is simply not relevant here.  If you can find legitimate news sources or counterterrorism analysts who provide a justification for its relevance here then it will be worth considering but right now it has no relevance whatsoever.  Your speculation about the credibility of the 9/11 Commission on issues not addressed by Able Danger is just pure speculation.  From someone, I might add, whose own credibility is very much in question.  I will continue to delete references to Able Danger until someone establishes their relevance in a meaningful way, not through a string of random speculations barely tied together by a thread like the above.  And again, let us please remember that the 9/11 Commission is not the issue here anyway.  The commission is cited but the pieces of evidence they look at are all pieces of intelligence brought out by other agencies.  As for the arrest of Iraqis in Germany, again, if you find evidence or even authoritative speculation tying those arrests to Able Danger we can consider it - otherwise it is just a string of increasingly bankrupt attempts at pseudo-logic. 05:11"

 The 2014 Inquest 

NB This was originally posted, by a different editor, under Talk:Hillsborough disaster#Missing from this article? but I'm moving it to its own section so it doesn't get lost. 2.25.115.116  

Currently the article does not convey the fact that a new Inquest into the Hillsboroguh Fans' deaths has begun. 

Changes to the article are likely to be actually controversial or be seen to be controversial for the next year or so, regardless of source. New facts may emerge into the public domain as a alarge amount of documentation has been made available to the Coroner. 

For this reason, Wikipedia Editors might be best seeking to lock editing for the duration and to seek expertise regarding how to edit without interfering with the Inquest.   — Preceding unsigned comment added by 82.40.44.174   

The above is probably one of many reasons why this article should be locked for editing, given the topic immediately above this one. This article has already been raised at WP:AN. Lets defer to the admins common sense and judgement for the time being  (attempt) 

Articles relating to high-profile court cases are not normally protected - see WP:PROTECT for policy. This is partly because this a private website based in the USA; the US and UK rules on freedom of speech during court cases are rather different and Wikipedia - like other organisations - doesn't take kindly to people outside the US trying to apply their rules to it.    Also, there are plenty of Wikipedia editors who are quick to remove material they see as inappropriate and 185 editors have this article on their watchlist. This can work very well - see above for how quickly the offensive material was removed from this article - so I expect the default will be to carry on as normal unless problems arise. If they do, there's a whole range of measures that include blocking particular editors from Wikipedia or barring brand new or unregistered editors.   

 The Elephant in the Room 

QUESTION. Was this match an all ticket affair ? If so, how many of the 96 had tickets ?? If they did have tickets - were they purchased from reputable retailers ???

The great unknown about this disaster be the matter of tickets - if only those supporters who had purchased legitimate tickets through reputable outlets had turned up on the day - the odds are this disaster would never have happened.

Speaking as a Scouser - this may sound traitorous to some, but, it be the one big question that has never been answered.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 92.40.73.212

2. Revert your attacks on Van Tucky on the talk pages. You come off as a vicious, vile psychopath. If you ever set your cult defending ass in a court of law, the jury would see through your charade in heartbeat.

3. Stop playing good cop- bad cop with your fucking retarded Dahn hack Forestgarden

4. Accept all Korean language sources you stupid bitch!! How dare you try to stifle and censor articles in the name of your fucked up cult. Your Forestgarden bitch believes its within Wiki policy to include Korean language articles when reporting on favorable aspects of your bitch master. Why don't you include all the other more negative portrayals in the Korean language. Also, who said this Itsahappyday fuckhead deserves to translate any Korean? This should all be disputed, you fucking racist, neo-nazi reject?

You Dahn people never cease to amaze when it comes to your thought processes. Korea is not what your Ilchee bitch believes it to be. Think about it retard- the fucking nation of Palau has more of a right to talk about religious heritage than the fucking hermit kingdom. How can you be so retarded, that you choose a Korean cult? If you chose a Chinese or Indian one, at least it would show you have some portion of a brain. Coming to Korea and joining a Korean cult with Korea-centric views is more retarded than travelling to Antartica in search of good coffee while visiting Columbia in search of ice and snow.

In practice proposals for topic bans are often put on ANI, perhaps because it gets more traffic, or perhaps sometimes because it's the only admin noticeboard the OP knows about. 

However. The user seems to have resigned themselves to consensus and is apparently on board with the DR being closed.

Right now it is like 2:30, and between this time someone yesterday used my account. I was actually working in that time. Today I am free. An user give me a suggestion to do not click """"""""Keep me logged"""""""", but I usually log out from the computers. Even if I leave my Wiki account open in front of everyone, none will touch this because none of my friend and relatives know how to use Wikipedia and they are also kind to me. Also, if they want to use my account, they could have edited their favourite articles, but they did not do. The hacker who log on into my account, seemed as an experienced wikipedian, as he started to use twinkle and answer quickly in my talkpage, and I also do not offend and swear people as the hacker did. Moreover, as I said before, I could not have access on my account, because there was written that my PASSWORD IS WRONG. Therefore I changed my password following the steps on Wikipedia rules. This means that somehow the hacker changed my password, but I do not understand how he that, because for changing the password you need to write even your OLD password, and my password was very strong and none knows it. But, my password was the same of password of my Google Email. Through this email, I emailed some wikipedians. I suspect a little bit a wikipedian named Justice007, because one time I emailed him but he did not answer, and maybe he dicovered my password somehow by my email. Otherwise maybe another user named UniversalTiger, who tried to offend me previously and left a message on my talkpage in Urdu language.

I rechecked the source, and see that the Saxony section is definitely separate from the Austria section. I decided to just change the section title from """"Austria"""" to """"Saxony"""", since that is more accurately what the article says (and doesn't get into the complexity of how old kingdoms map onto present day ones).

Bipolar affective disorder (in particular the manic phase) frequently displays phenomena outlined in this article as formal thought disorder, for example circumstantiality and tangentiality - but it is a totally different clinical entity to schizophrenia. Displaying formal thought disorder doesn't automatically earn the label of schizophrenia in the clinical setting, it is more indicative of psychosis in general (with whatever underlying cause). Incidentally pressured speech is often not referred to by clinicians as ``formal thought disorder`` but thought more to be a sign of the underlying symptom of racing thoughts (commonly described by and found in manic patients). It is also observed in a separate category of the mental state examination (which by one commonly used model goes Appearance/Behaviour, Speech (where pressure is noted), Mood/Affect, Thought (both form and content), Perception, Intelligence/Cognition, Rapport, Insight/Judgement). I freely admit this is opinion, observation and experience based on study and working as a psychiatric resident at a hospital for three months, but I can heartily recommend reading both the DSM-V and a great text by Kaplan & Sadoch for accurate but accessible descriptions of the terms and their associations.

so far...

CorpseFucking Art (C.F.A.) are an Brutal Death Metal/ deathgrind band, from  Italy formed in 1993. Their lyrics focuses mainly on gore and Humor.

Biography

The band was formed in Rome in 1993. With the first line-up (Max - gurgling, Andrea - guitars, Fabio - bass, Marco - drums) under a different name Enthralment and recorded their first demo called Eulogy Of Burning Christ. The official sound was a slow and brutal death-metal influenced by Immolation and Incantation.

Cryptic Soul Productions signed Enthralment released the 7"""" Accursed In Divinity. However. the sound contained in the new tracks were defenitely more brutal oriented. As the musical direction was no longer the same as the beginning, it was useless to keep the old name. The one choosen for this new form of madness was Corpsegod. With a different name but same line-up, they recorded in 1995 the mini cd Opinion About Sorrow released by Torture Records. The mini cd contained 5 tracks of original and strange brutal death-metal. Ultrabrutal riffing with techno and industrial parts, splatter movies - Opinion About Sorrow a really vanguard record compared to the others on the death-metal scene.

Though, the passion for the ultrabrutal death-metal in the band was getting higher and higher. The old line-up went to create a new band totally devoted to the brutal death-metal without compromises. A new band was born then, Corpsefucking Art. From the old line-up Andrea and Max were still there. After recording a 2 tracks promo with the new line up (Massimo - guitar, Marcello - drums, Edo - bass) and the track Molesting The Corpse for the underground splatter movie Sick-o-pathic soundtrack. The band played as support for Cannibal Corpse and Immolation for a show in Rome. Corpsefucking Art recorded their debut CD named A Puzzle Of Flesh for the italian label Sterminio Productions. Nine tracks of blasting ultrabrutal death-metal without mercy. An inhuman voice and a blasting riffing made A Puzzle Of Flesh known in the underground.

In 2001 the line-up changed again. Andrea the only member from the first line up joined up with Marco (bass) and Stuart (drums). They recorded a new split CD with Goretrade Zombiecronomicon distributed by Coagulated Records. In april 2002, United Guttural Records took the license by Coagulated records and restamped the split cd with Goretrade, released with a completely new artwork.

After being offered a contract by Forever Underground, Corpsefucking Art entered the studio to record their new full length Splatter Deluxe with the new second guitarist Marco Riccardi. Between the recording and the long wait to the new cd to be out, the band takes part in a lot of live performances including festival in Frankfurt with Lividity, Gorerotted, Inhumate, Pigstry, Nunwhore Commando 666, Mastic Scum, Master and Damnable and the rest of Europe in places like Sweden, France and Italy. The band is currently, in 2008, recording a new studio album and is aspected to come out early 2009.

That's what i was going for! Thank you. haha Hey you guys just wanted to say i'm posting Cat's Funny Moments 3 very soon. Keep loking :D I know Kelly Clarkson have more experience on the music world but is it just me or she sound exacly like Jessie J on this song? :D Does someone here watches How I Met Your Mother? Because the backgroud song is the one who's stuck on Marshal's Fiero. haha 3 I wish Daniella was there to represent vegetarians like me (: Um what fish didn't you eat? Like... none of them."

0,"Sorry dude, as a physicist I know that there is not any generally accepted position on whether the universe had a prime mover or whether one was necessary or not or whether there is a necessary being.  Our only two cites for this section, which claims the argument has been scientifically refuted, which is not true, are a popular science book and a popular science lecture.  Now I'm not disrespecting Kaku or Hawking, but Hawking's statement that there was not time before the universe began is not his, it goes back to Augustine of Hippo, which Hawking says in I believe A Brief History of Time, and so is not in opposition to any basic Christian philosophy about God.  And as I pointed out, physicists and cosmologists do investigate what might have happened before the big bang.  It's not a scientifically meaningless question as this section is trying to claim.  And Kaku's description of the molecules in the jar not being moved, as I pointed out, is not motion from nothing.  The molecules had to have a probability or potential to move.  The reason things can move without another body moving them is they had a probability to move based on the uncertainty principle.  When you ask physicists why a particle just started moving or why for instance the particles are generated in a vacuum, they would say because of the uncertainty principle and the laws of quantum physics.  That's implying a cause.  There was a cause for the motion or the creation, not something out of nothing.  Now laws of physics and probabilities are not nothing.  And where did they come from?  Hawking I believe in a actual paper he wrote had the universe jumpstarted from a primeordial wave function, see Hartle-Hawking state, but where did that come from?  And this idea, as most ideas about the initial conditions of the universe, has been in no way accepted by all or even most scientists.  So unless it can be shown from a credible cited source that the vast majority of physicists and cosmologists hold that the cosmological argument has actually been scientifically refuted, not that they just don't personally accept it or something like that, we should not be making that claim.  For instance the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy makes no such claim, and has several pros and cons for the argument based on modern science, including the example of vacuum motion and vacuum genesis.  And as for popular science sources, Carl Sagan always held that the idea of a creator and generator of the universe had neither been proven nor disproven by science."
