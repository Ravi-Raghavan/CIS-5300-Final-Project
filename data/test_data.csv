One of the most basic rules here is that information in articles must be ``sourced`` to a ``reliable source,`` which is explained here: WP:RS. In the case of the Montana edit that you made, all the published sources list Joe's birthplace as New Eagle, Pennsylvania. If you have a published source that says Butte, Montana, you would have to insert it after the edit that you make. One way to do this is to click on the open book icon above the editing window to the left of ``Advanced.`` A dialogue box will appear in which you can paste the URL for your source, or you can list the publication. The preferred method for sourcing, though, is listed here: WP:CT.  :Unfortunately, insider information like knowing JM's son cannot be used as a source. Sources must be reliable and published, as above. I have some firsthand experience with this. One of my younger brothers is Terry Moran, and for several years the Wikipedia article had the wrong birth year for him. This was because the ABC News website had the wrong year - but I could not change the year and say ``he's my brother and I know when he was born.`` I had to find a published source that confirmed the correct date.

Mussolini, alas, insisted on a glorious entry into the city for his Italian troops. The Führer yielded to the Italian demand and together the German and Italian troops marched into Athens. This miserable spectacle, laid on by our gallant ally, must have produced some hollow laughter from the Greeks. 
 Wilhelm Keitel[109] 

 I propose that this insert box be deleted because it casts the Italians in too bad a light. It does nothing to enhance the article's balance and neutrality, but in fact, detracts from it. Why was Keitel's view highlighted in the first place? Was it designed to denigrate the Italians? Simply because a German general had this view, doesn't mean it has to be included in the article.

I must mention that a couple of the texts are actually fictitious accounts of Elizabeth Báthory and should not be viewed as being historical biographies, e.g. Bathory Al Babel, and Andrei Codrescu.  Perhaps these two books should be removed and tranferred to the article on Elizabeth Báthory in popular culture?  The inclusion of additional Hungarian and Slovak texts, though not accessible to most in English, gives the list of sources greater depth and scope since Elizabeth Báthory was a Hungarian who spent much of her life in what is now Slovakia.  Therefore, inclusion of references from those two cultures/countiries is relevant. "

Even when something is discussed in the body, the lead is still ``written at a greater level of generality than the body``. Basically, Proto–Dravidian, which is discussed at length in the article, doesn't find a mention in the lead, while the relationship between Indus script and Dravidian languages, which is so far not mentioned in the body, finds a place. Farmer, Rao etc. are not relevant right now, but if you plan on adding content pertaining to IVC, you will have to give alternate POVs some weight (not sure how much) unless they are fringe (which is probably not the case here).  `"

Even if all of the arguments I've presented here are seen to carry no weight, I fail to see how the wealth of reliable sources that I've sited have been so readily dismissed as irrelevant, giving not so much as a single mention within the body of the article.  And aside from the one's I had highlighted, there were plenty of reliable sources reporting on the December VatiLeaks Dossier, with that document's connection to the resignation decision.  I find it shocking to see so many editors here to not want a single mention of any of that.  So the decision for now is to continue presenting an article on Benedict's resignation as though there was absolutely no connection to any of the scandals, and to pretend that all of the reliable sources that do point to such connections don't exist.

Page Rebuild

For quite some time, the Alcoholism entry has provided out of date or incorrect information. I'm in the process of rewriting it to meet contemporary scientific standards for the disease. I welcome external review and discussion. 
 Stuart Gitlow MD (Chief, Annenberg Physician Training Program in Addictive Disease, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, NYC)

Thanks for your contributions so far.  You may be interested in creating a user account.  Some of the benefits are discussed at this page: Wikipedia:Why_create_an_account%3F  

It greatly reduces the chances people will revert your changes, for one thing. -)  

Good points, and I've created an account as you suggest. See my notes below as well. sg

In response to the commentary at the very, very bottom of this page (dupe social impacts), I've rearranged the content of the page a bit.  I believe that it now better reflects the chronology of how people are impacted by alcoholism, and therefore reflects the order in which this information becomes important to people: definition, effects, diagnoses, treatment, broader issues.

FYI, I renamed the first instance of Social Issues to read """"Societal Issues"""" and moved it into the broader issues area.  I moved the latter one up to become a subheading of the """"Effects"""" category.  After this edit I'm going to go remove the original note of this (because it's no longer germain), so you'll have to look at the next edit in order to read it.  

In looking over the article and the discussion of Stanton Peele's perspective et al, I'm wondering whether some of the ongoing discussion held on this page is about a misconception that alcoholism is equal to """"excessive drinking,"""" whatever that is. Alcoholism doesn't refer to someone who drinks a lot. Many people drink a great deal but aren't alcoholic. Conversely, many alcoholics don't drink very much at all compared against the general population's intake.  

The section on """"terminology"""" that you removed was intended to address exactly this misunderstanding.  Since you seem to think it's important, I'm putting it back in.  

righto 

Despite the difficulties that we've had of late, the entry is coming together nicely. I'm looking over the EFFECTS section, which has a good deal of information on alcohol itself, and the impact of alcohol USE. It is difficult to tease out the effects of alcoholism versus the effects of alcohol. The effects of alcoholism when an alcoholic is in recovery, for example, would be different from the effects of alcoholism while an individual is drinking on a daily basis. (This is similar, of course, to the situation with other diseases - the effects of diabetes when an individual has well-controlled blood glucoses are different from the effects of untreated diabetes). Nevertheless, I wonder whether the entire section would be more appropriately found in the alcohol article rather than here in the alcoholism article. Can we build a consensus regarding this area?  

 Alcoholism vs. Alcohol abuse 

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism make a difference between one and the other. What I found more confusing is that from """"alcohol abuse"""" you're redirected to """"alcoholism"""".

""""Alcoholism, also known as 'alcohol dependence,' is a disease that includes four symptoms: craving, loss of control, physical dependence, and tolerance"""". 

Moreover, """"Alcohol abuse differs from alcoholism in that it does not include an extremely strong craving for alcohol, loss of control over drinking, or physical dependence"""", etc etc.

>> Getting the facts @ NIAAA

 

Response:  Good point.  From one interested perspective, AA literature itself discusses this issue and draws a clear distinction between alcohol abuse and alcoholism. 

I can't make the correction. I'm not that good informed and my english is quite lousy. Could you..?  

How about mentioning something about alcoholism as a form of drug addiction? Correct me if I'm wrong, but alcohol is certainly a hard drug, characterized by intense (and possibly fatal) withdrawals... isn't that addiction?

This is mostly true.  The root"

0,"` :::::::::::*Sorry, but Wikipedia disagrees with you, and so does the US Government in the person of the Securities and Exchange Commission!  ::::::::::::``The X.com company was then renamed PayPal in 2001``. That's a quote from Wikipedia's PayPal article. The article references PayPal's own history which states that (1) in March 2000 ``Confinity merges with X.com, taking on its company name`` and (2) in June 2001 ``PayPal officially takes its name: X.com officially changes its name to PayPal, to match the name of its most popular product.`` I'd say that was pretty conclusive. But there's more... ::::::::::::Your comments about X.com and Confinity becoming part of PayPal represents a complete misunderstanding of how company law works. A company is a legal entity: there were two entities and then one of them was swallowed by the other and ceased to exist. If you're not sure about that just check the SEC here. This site is the definitive record so there's no getting round what it says. It shows TWO companies called PayPal, not one. PayPal Funds Inc was formerly X.com Funds and is, essentially, a bagman for PayPal Inc. And this document supplied by shareholders states that ``PayPal, Inc. resulted from a merger between Confinity, Inc.... and X.com Corporation``. As for the name change, the document states that ``We incorporated as X.com Corporation in March 1999... On March 30, 2000, X.com merged with Confinity, Inc., with X.com as the surviving entity... We formally changed our name to PayPal, Inc. in February 2001.`` So there you have it, from the horse's mouth and accepted as fact by the SEC: X.Com Inc swallowed Confinity Inc which ceased to exist. Some time later X.Com became PayPal Inc. X.Com's financial infrastructure became PayPal's financial infrastructure. It would be misleading in the extreme to say anything else.    `"

 I think the movie makes it a little ambiguous as to who is throwing out the men from the windows at the beginning.  When Vadinho shows the picture of young Tony with his parents, he says `in those days I didn't have to kill to find you`.  And he *is* the one who chucks Tony out the window.  Either way, the hero never has a `wait, what's this about killing?` moment and Vadinho's comment is never mentioned again.  I'ts also unclear how the defenestration would help the villain's gang.  Since the one person who would survive the fall is the person they want dead, they would still be faced with the chore of finding another way to get rid of him. 

 Since this article has a trivia section, you could also update it to reflect the fact that despite the explicit references to Aztec mythology, at the end of the film, Vadinho says that the mask will be returned to the Andes, meaning this should have been an Incan myth."

0,"    drprinceton  The way wiki immediately took down the 8 prime spirals pages and the minor referer pages about the person that discovered it way back in 1995 who also has a new project known as HelixQ is a joke.  Let's see the argument of wiki is that the 8 Prime Spirals are not 'peer reviewed', in academia anything involving crypto and national security has been censored for decades and in 1995 when the original paper came out revealing numerous new prime theory that was years ahead of prime theory then, there was no way for such work to even be published, so USENET was how it was distributed, and it's a fact usenet has been heavily edited involving the topic.  Now you can all point to your rules about 'peer review' but this shows how ignorant everyone thus far is about academia and censoring of math involving primes and crypto. Let's see wiki has a page on Dr. Bernstein, a guy that took the NSA to court in 1995 the same year the paper was released, so that's how restricted publishing prime theory as it relates to crypto was in 1995, and is still today.  You expect NSA funded journals like AMS to allow such information to be 'peer reviewed'?  Anyway, my original article was 'heavy handed' killed by 'mods' at wiki and if you don't think the NSA has infiltrated wiki and almost every type of mass social media on the net (and yes to me wiki is a social media/project) then you need to read on the Snowden documents.  So the article put a light on some very interesting 'prime theory' that is supported by GitHub, anyone can check the github cite to see the info that every so-called prime algorithm and many have pages on wiki, all failed to outperform a 2300 year old algorithm, aka sieve of Eratosthenes, all expect for one algorithm, a prime spiral algorithm that I KNOW has been around since 1995 and a theory that has been heavily censored by the NSA since almost any reference to the many posts about ENNISA Prime Formula has been erased from Usenet, the original 'social media' of the net.  That all being said, I'm constantly now being 'threatened' by who? Mods that think me insisting the removal of the original page is suspect to obvious manipulation most likely by the NSA?  Prove wiki has no NSA bots or mods controlling the discussion, put the page up and let it be edited properly.   The original article was what I would think any real mod not working for the NSA would agree was pretty NPOV, and the 'cite' to github verified the whole claims, that a new prime algorithm is beating all known prime algorithms, something the other wiki page prime algorithms do not do.  The original article referenced the discover is connected to obvious 'disinfomation' as well, and the continued supression of anyone discussing his work and him as was done by wiki in this article is defacto proof that the PTB want to keep the public and academia in the dark about significant advancements in prime theory.  Anyone can google NSA and the major journals you think are 'peer reviewed', what do you see searching NSA and AMS, oh it's funded by the NSA. LOL  That's your 'peer review', so any real mod here can step in and put the original article back. The PyPrimes test of the algorithm shows how major this work is.  Then the public can decide who discovered it, I know the origin is 1995 and 1997, I've been following it that long, and to see wiki put up pages about a slow 60Mod algorithm from 2004 that was discussed in the same prime work in 1995 is a joke.  Then you start to peel away who are the guys involved in all this new crypto and prime work and you start to see nothing but NSA funded projects.  What you don't think the NSA had laws in place for decades banning such work? They did. And now they control the academic journals with funding to furthr control what is released about anything that can impact crypto and the heart of crypto is what, PRIME NUMBER THEORY.  The mere fact that a project that is open to PUBLIC SCRUTINY by competent computer programmers has shown for over two years a new prime algorithm is the so-called king of the hill of prime theory, and wiki mods and most likely NSA/wiki mods are doing their best to treat the PyPrimes speed tests like they are insignificant.  The fact is PyPrimes exposed how advanced the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni was by it beating all the major prime algorithms.  The fact is PyPrimes referred to the 1995 30Mod Prime algorithm as 'Croft Spirals', which is a joke since Croft created his site about the theory in 2010, then in 2012 PyPrimes picked it up, and now wiki is saying so what, there's a new prime algorithm that dethroned every prime algorithm wiki has pages on.  I personally think I did a great job of being NPOV and then to see mods come along and OUTRIGHT LIE it was not cited is more disinfo, then to see mods saying no peer review, yeah sure, NSA controlled math journals are going to print what they want buried, a real new prime algorithm that can out do any known algorithm and also do what the Snowden documents says the NSA has done, that being cooking ECC seed keys issued by NIST and ENISA.  The needs to be a wiki page on this, it's a 'big deal' if you understand math and primes that the PyPrimes tests have verified a major advance in primality was made.  I could have cited many so-called 'news sites' in the article but I know they are not NPOV sites, so why bother.  PyPrimes test is a legitimate cite and by having the prime spirals 'out in the open' so they appear for prime related searches by anyone in the world as the page will eventually do, will expose to the world, did you know a major new prime algorithm exists and test it yourself, download python, download pyprimes, run the tests yourself, and when anyone does, they all ask, WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THIS.  Oh, I tried to discuss it on wiki and what happened? ARTICLE DELETED in minutes.  LOL  Now I'm being threatened with a permanent ban for questioning mods that are either working for the NSA or really just bad mods that have no clue about why NSA controlled academica journals will never discuss a prime algorithm that the NSA uses to cook ECC seed keys.  Now if you don't think the NSA has cooked all the ECC crypto, read wiki leaks, it was done, how was it done?  They got the ENNISA Prime algorithm in 1995 when they seized the computers of Dr. Adoni, do you want me to cite SIX US SUPREME COURT CASE FILES over his false imprisonment in US jails over bogus cases? They exist.  So while many who refuse to do THE RESEARCH to verify these claims will say tin hat loon, it's real, very real, just like the PyPrimes primality tests is very real and repeatable so anyone can redo the work and see a major advance in primes was made and it's 30mod prime spirals and the discovery happened in 1995.  Why would wiki have a page on SoA, sieve of Atkin from 2004? 60Mod prime algorithm is based on 30Mod, 2x30Mod gets you 60mod, incase you can't do basic math.  Oh, the paper on it came out AMS, the co-author is tied to the creator of ECC the crypto now cooked by the NSA.  haha  Again, none of these claims of conspiracy were in the original article, but I'm sure discussing them now.  PUT THE ARTICLE BACK let it be properly edited and cited it is controversial and then see how the article stands.    DrPrinceton"

Thirdly, you somehow ``forget`` that whether the minorities (not only Slovak) have a ``weak identity`` or not, the Hungarian government - unlike the governements of all its neighbouring countries - has abolished schools with the respective languages as languages of instruction (you can play with words, but that is a fact), bilingual schools - even if they would work, which they did not - are not enough and above all there was absolutely no reason for such a deterioration other then finishing the Magyarisation (and this aim was successfully achieved). Or are you implying that since the minorities had such ``weak identity``, the government decided to help them by cancelling education in their mother language??

Many of the sections first introduce the topic, which is discussion of the legislation or the argument/dispute and then go into pro/con.  The graph in Distribution of Tax burden is discussed in this section (second sentence and the second to last sentence) and further discussed in the sub-article.  Yes - it does suggest that all tax levels in the graph would decrease due to the larger tax base and taxation of wealth.  The source is also provided for those that want more details.

Catholics teach that not only your belief in god is necessary, but also your actions on earth, to get into heaven. So they also focus on kindness toward others. For Protestants, only the belief and acceptance of god is necessary, so taking advantage of others isn't frowned upon."

You insist on removing clarifiers, such as MANY instead of making it seem as if all media has bought the official conspiracy theory as a fact.  This is far from true.

I make links to mainstream media polls which show over 1/3 of Americans think that 9/11 is an inside job, and you comment that I am exaggerating the importance of the movement.

Just a quick note:  I was commenting on the movie, which has been promoted by the independent media.  I think they deserve a mention, since they are significant to the topic at hand.

If you turn to other academic departments at a university like Brown, I imagine you'll find faculty members, departmental chairs, and so on, more influential than Landow in their respective fields but with no little """"who's who"""" wikipedia write-ups to show for it.

 == 1999 Stanley Cup Final  Ignorance of Possesion Rules and Bias in wording == 

 In the 1999 season summary, I believe there is significant bias in the article. 

 Point by Point: 

 In the sixth game of the seven-game series, Brett Hull's triple-overtime goal - one that remains in dispute - How can something remain in dispute 5 and 1/2 years after it was decided conclusively by NHL officials still be """"in dispute"""" ?  If something was decided, it can no longer be in dispute.  

 as Hull's skate was visibly in the goal creaseended the series, and the Stars were awarded the Cup. (In 1999, it was illegal to score a goal whilst an offensive player's skate was in the goal crease. - This statement ignores the puck possesion continuance rule, that was was even discussed by Gary Thorne and Bill Clement while there 'appeared' to be some question to the legality of the goal. The 1999 NHL rulebook also allowed for a person in posession of the puck to enter the goal crease. Hull's first shot was from outside of the crease, while shooting momentum carried his foot into the crease. The subsequent 2 rebounds came right back to Hull's stick. The goal was allowed to stand by officials on the ice, and contrary to popular thought, was reviewed by replay officials. Possession of the puck was what made the goal legal in the eyes of NHL officials. The puck meerly bounced off Hasek's left leg pad, and was only controlled on the stick by Hull's 3 shots. Possesion of the puck was therefore maintained by Hull, which would make the goal legal.  

 At the time, even Dallas Morning News hockey writer Keith Gave questioned the legality of the goal. 
 This may have been the case, but Keith Gave was notrious in Dallas for NOT being a pro-Stars beat writer.  His tenure at the Dallas Morning News was short lived, in comparison to writers at the Morning News since. 
 Regardless, the article fails to mention that those supporting the legality of the goal included Al Strachan of the Toronto Sun, Don Cherry of the CBC, and Wayne Gretzky - all of whom generally have broader appeal and understanding of the game than Keith Gave would.   

 This article has a general appearance of being either a) Pro-Buffalo Sabres  or  b) Anti-Dallas Stars  or c) Both 

 I suggest opposing viewpoints on this 'controversial' event in the history of the Buffalo Sabres, Dallas Stars, and the NHL be allowed on this page."""

And would you be able to at least get me started? I usually only need to be shown something once, so with luck this should be a one-off request.  As a suggestion, you or another admin might want to look at a random sampling of Tango's deletions; one thing I can't do, but expect is fine, as almost all of the articles remain redlinks. I am thinking it would be helpful to the arbitrators to be reassured there are no concerns about Tango's administrative work in other areas, so they can focus on the one issue before them.   Thanks again for your offer of assistance.    "

The link for ``Giant African Scops`` gives the scientific name as Ptilopsis leucotis which refers to the Northern White-faced Owl, not the Southern, and since this link is right next to the link for Popo-chan, I assume that link must be intended to tell readers what kind of owl Popo-chan is.

I am not as claimed, a pr crony for Jeffrey Epstein. I do though come from a science journalist background, had heard of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard, and when I came across this article I was quite taken by the lob-sided presentation of this piece. It struck me immediately as slanderous vs. having a neutral point of view. MONEY LAUNDERING: the link that was added to back this, does not connect through. That is extremely problematic given that this is in the lead of the piece and libel if not properly sourced. I googled money laundering and Jeffrey Epstein and found the article url that mentions it but this is what I found, and I quote: ``Yet a source tells The Daily Beast that Epstein’s legal troubles may not be over. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT, as an outgrowth of the 2007 Florida investigation, federal investigators are now looking into allegations of money laundering and other financial misdeeds. Villafana notes at the end of her letter to Lefkowitz: “You accuse me of broadening the scope of the investigation without any foundation for doing so by adding charges of money laundering and violations of a money transmitting business to the investigation. Again, I consulted with the Justice Department’s Money Laundering Section about my analysis...the duty officer agreed with my analysis.”NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENSomething being ``possible`` in the press is not the same as something that actually ``is`` as claimed in the lead of the article. So, so far the lead is misleading and false. Unless you can find an article that confirms that he IS under investigation for money laundering, I think it should be removed. PROGRAM for EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS: this was entirely established from Jeffrey Epstein's $30 million, as was the research that was the first to mathematically quantify the in vivo kinetics of human cancer cells. That was a major achievement in the filed of cancer and I think it should be allowed back into the article.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENThank you for your thoughts. PS. I didn't use this talk page because I simply overlooked it and so went to your individual talk pages instead.

Possible Original Research:
I only skimmed through on these parts, but it seems to me that most of this needs to be cited - either for verification, or simply for the sake of further reading.

1. French people often refer to Metropolitan France as L'Hexagone (The """"Hexagon"""") because of the geometric shape of its territory.

Unless it was a Frenchman or Frenchwoman who added that in, how can we know for certain that they really do? Is this self-made nickname for that region so internationally renowned that it's a surefire fact? Unless one can respond in the affirmative to either question, It needs a citation.

2. There are various theories as to the origin of the name of the Franks. One is that it is derived from the Proto-Germanic word frankon which translates as javelin or lance as the throwing axe of the Franks was known as a francisca.

Another proposed etymology is that in an ancient Germanic language, Frank means free as opposed to slave. This word still exists in French as franc, it is also used as the translation of """"Frank"""" and to name the local money, until the use of the Euro in the 2000s.

However, rather than the ethnic name of the Franks coming from the word frank, it is also probable that the word is derived from the ethnic name of the Franks, the connection being that only the Franks, as the conquering class, had the status of freemen. In German, France is still called Frankreich, which literally means """"Realm of the Franks"""". In order to distinguish from the Frankish Empire of Charlemagne, Modern France is called Frankreich, while the Frankish Realm is called Frankenreich.

Now here we're talking about cite-cite-cite-for-crying-out-loud-cite! Some of this might not only be original research, but speculation, also! Two Wikipedia-no-nos riddled into one! It seems like you only walk one paragraph or two down the article and bam! The poor thing is literally kissed with original research! Something has to be done!

An animated Drogba needed restraining by stewards and his manager Guus Hiddink at the end of the game. Drogba felt he should have had a penalty and his side also had two appeals turned down for handball, with the Spanish giants then grabbing a stoppage-time strike to go through on away goals. The Ivory Coast frontman, who was unhappy after being subbed in 72nd minute, approached the referee after the game. He then turned to the television camera, shouting that the official was a “f****** disgrace”. Chelsea fans also threw flags at the officials and the Barcelona bench. In the Champions League final last season against Manchester United, Drogba was sent off for raising his hands to Nemanja Vidic.  I sine now do I. Make lots of numbers. Here it is.   `"

Similarly, I don't think the civil war in Sri Lanka is really triggered by the way people simply want war. Indeed it has purposes, such as seizing political power, getting rid of oppositions, fulfilling violent desires, shaping a new future of Sri Lanka, etc. There must be motivation and intentions, and we never do things simply for the sake of it.

Michael Petrou article
Cool Hand Luke added criticism of Press TV from this article.  That's fine. As we agreed earlier all TV station articles have a criticism section.

However, this particular article goes on to say """"Only five days after launching, Press TV invited me to take part in a televised panel discussion about journalism in the Middle East. I argued that the biggest challenge facing journalists in the region is a lack of freedom and cited, among other examples, the case of Zahra Kazemi, the Canadian photojournalist who was raped, tortured and murdered by Iranian officials after she was arrested for taking photographs outside the Evin prison in Tehran. To his credit, the host and chief press officer, Shahab Mossavat, did not interrupt or silence me. He called my comments """"offensive"""" to Iran but pointed out that I was given free rein to say what I wished by Press TV. He then steered the conversation toward obstacles confronted by journalists in Israel."""" 

Thus the author demonstrates that Press TV let him criticize the Iranian government, which contradicts the criticism from the article. If we're going to add the critical parts of an article, shouldn't we add one sentence about the positive elements of the article too? What do you think? """

Consensus Can Change
A small group of editors can reach a consensual decision, but when the article gains wider attention, others may then disagree. The original group should not block further change on grounds that they already have made a decision.
...
Wikipedia's decisions are ever-changing, because new people visit every day, and through new information and new ideas, we may gain insights we did not have previously. It is important that there is a way to challenge past decisions, however these decisions were reached. Decisions should therefore practically never be """"binding"""" in the sense that the decision cannot be taken back.
(Emphasis added)

Also see the flowchart at that page, particularly the first two boxes. I came across the article that was in a previous consensus, and made a change. That should not, no, can not be considered vandalism.  (talk|Contribs)

Furthermore, I'm not actually convinced consensus has been reached here, with regard to the port/spinoff/version/other-term debate. From what I can tell by going through all the comments here,  strongly believes that """"spinoff"""" is the only acceptable term;  """"isn't sure"""" but believes """"port"""" is definitely not the right term, and leans slightly toward """"other versions""""; , , and at least one unsigned comment all believe that """"spinoff"""" is not appropriate and that """"version"""" should be chosen as, while less specific, is not inaccurate by any interpretation;  supports """"spinoff"""" but feels there might be some other, better term nobody has thought of;  believes that a variety of terms should be used;  votes for """"spinoff.""""

So out of eight contributors, we have one very strong supporter of """"spinoff"""", two more moderate supporters of """"spinoff"""", three supporters of """"version"""" (and one """"slight support"""") and one supporter of """"all of the above.""""

So I have two questions,
Have I summarized everyone's position accurately?
Is there really a consensus here? (I don't think there is, yet)

My neighbor, Alan Blanchard, had said goodbye to his wife, Sheila, and gone up to Telegraph Ave. to work at the Berkeley Reperatory Theater doing carpentry.

I agree that it is problematic to harmonize all of the elements, but the next paragraph focuses on the right wing stuff (i.e., totalitariansm, etc.), and the third paragraph delves into the economics ideology. Neither of those is contradictory to the lead. Fascism arose during a fragmentary, transitional period, and it ideology embraced what today may seem to be contradictory elements. It's probably better to try and get that across earlywhich the reference to ``national syndicalism`` should facilitate, than oversimplify.NEWLINE_TOKENRegarding the deleted material, I think there are some claims made there that would have to be sourced and attributed or based on a substantial body of text in the main article that provided context (and sourcing). It should be borne in mind that the WWII-era fascist states of Italy and Germany along with the then quasi-fascist Japan formed the ``axis``, for example, so the claim of xenophobia seems somewhat specious to me, though ethnocentrism sounds plausible. Just because it sounds plausible, however, does not mean that there are RS describing it as such. Militarism is a common thread, but how does monumental architecture relate to that? The sentence seems somewhat forced, so there has to be a concrete source connecting those in an intelligible manner.見学/迷惑 `"

I urge you to read the long history records on the Ronald Ryan article and discussion pages. There have been defamatory and false edits against Ryan and his living family menbers. We know meatpuppets are using various fake IPs to add false material and to removal of factual material. In one of many recent disgusting edits by meatpuppet/s, Ryan was accused of having sexual relations with his own daughter. In another disgusting edit Ryan was accused of being born a homosexual. Ryan is dead but his family members are alive to take legal action against these meatpuppets. 

Ryan’s surviving members of his family will continue to correct the distorted, manipulated opinions and views of one book author Mike Richards, whilst all other referenced material is ignored, vandalized and removed. The scapegoat/excuse being used by these meatpuppets is wrong as it is outrageous. Members of the Ryan family are alive and well. 

Supporters of Ronald Ryan will forever unite on the facts of his case and execution. We will continue to contribute the facts, based on the hundreds of references that diagree with Richards personal views. Facts like: There is no scientific evidence whatsoever to prove Ryan fired a shot. 

To put it bluntly, the meatpuppets refuse to allow any contributions on the facts of the Ryan case. Their hatred for Ryan is rather sick and disturbing to say the least.

0,"NEWLINE_TOKEN:::I'm going to be harshere still No we should not remove it. Stenger doesn't have to give a source. TG continually confuses what editors have to do with what authors of source material have do do. As for making stuff up, see Psychological_projection.  What we can see from the recent discussion on SU(5) is not that Stenger was wrong, but that either TG is a pathological liar or utterly incapable of reading technical material. Usually, I apply Hanlon's Razor to these kinds of dilemmas, but your track record here it too long and extensively documented to opt for the stupidity explanation for your actions. Barr is absolutely the first paper to describe Flipped SU(5), derived from SU(5),and his 1982 paper is repeatedly referenced for it, as anyone would discover from even the most casual of Google searches.   Similarly, Stenger was absolutely correct about Derendinger's 1984 paper.  And, I've read the papers, and your statements about them are, to put it most charitably, grossly misleading at best, and less charitably, absolute falsehoods. There is nothing that I can think of that is more disruptive to, or destructive of, the aims of Wiki than the willingness of an editor like yourself to assert blatant falsehoods to try to push your POV on these articles. And yet you persist month after month, year after year, in the most outrageous falshoods, many of which were documented on COIN long before Will or I ever set eyes on this article, apparently with the motive of protecting this article that you wrote and had another editor post at Wiki. It is utterly unacceptable behavior, and frankly inexplicable since your claims are so easily falsified by any neutral editor. This has got to come to an end.  Now.   "

0,"`NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::MarnetteD clearly has a watch list longer than my arm given his response time to reverting things, so he'll see what's been done and will just have to deal with it. While categories may require reliable sourcing, to a degree, the fact remains than for so many actors dating back to the 50s, 60s, 70s, especially, there is unlikely to be centralised sourcing, though many books are in print, such as actor biogs, few editors are really going to dig them all out and cite hundreds of actors entire career for each TV and film appearance, it would take months, even years, of effort. Wikipedia:Citing IMDb notes that IMDB has been a constant source of dispute over its reliability. However, for a category to simply state ``this person was a Western (genre) TV actor`` hardly requires AAA-rated reliable sourcing, and I do believe than IMDB meets the requirements as a tertiary source, confirming the fact that all those actors were active in that genre. Many of the individual articles for each Western TV series don't contain any more sourcing than IMDB, so it is not wrong to identify MarnetteD's reverts as ``missing the point`` when it comes to avoiding WP:POINTed behaviour. A tertiary source is better than no source at all, and categories are hardly top-level articles worth war-editing over. I find his behaviour protracted, bullyish and contrived as well as completely lacking WP:AGF standards. He needs to holster his attitude, because I'm not afraid to present his behaviour, including repeated history of the same behaviour, to ANI/EW and request that action be taken for his abuse of policy and anti-IP sniping motions. The lack of maturity exhibited in reverting those articles without consensus, openly taking advantage of my 48 hour block, will not be seen in good taste as it was clearly an opportunistic move, but a very stupid one which I don't take lightly. WP:BURO and WP:IAR applies here. We don't need strict reliable sourcing for a category as all those actors have an IMDB page, the majority of those IMDB pages are accurate, and if the category aims to improve wiki by indexing all the actors of that genre, it is for the better. To filter out those which lack a reliable source lacks NPOV because there are dozens of categories which make statements about things and people which don't have strong sourcing. But in this case, knowing an actor was a Western TV actor is hardly controversial. If MarnetteD reverts a single page he should be prepared to back it up with something other than WP:DEFINING, which is a guideline, not policy, but so far as ``if the characteristic would not be appropriate to mention in the lead portion of an article, it is probably not defining`` goes, there are considerably more articles that don't follow that ideal to the letter than do, which makes it a weak guideline to attempt to enforce unless an editor has a strong motive to do so. If he enjoys attention and drama, I expect to see him an ANI/EW before the week's out.   `"

0,"`  :: Hie DVdm. I was writing what follows while you made your edit. I can't right now, but I will coming to review in detail your example. ::Thanks Johnuniq for your advice and input. Concerning the actual statement, I had already thought that after clearing things up with DVdm, I would rephrase it into something in the lines of ``He is an iconic and inspirational reference for the generation growing up in the late 1970s, early 1980s.`` Adding ``to some of the generation`` should clear your objection about the absence of stats. But that's not the really important issue here. The fact is that it is ethically improper from me and from Wikipedia to declare that the (you call it blog) site is not a reliable source here, but then find that the links and statements in ``Inertia Coupling`` or ``Alexander Abian`` are significant enriching contributions to the users of Wikipedia, and the sourced site is reliable there. BTW, in these two and the few other topics the source is mentioned, the statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis. It would be highly objectionable from Wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being, and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts, the links will be trashed out. At this point 1) The sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected. 2) It seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote, in most cases some synthesis is involved. 3) There is still the issue of the site being a reliable source. It seems to me that the Wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay, is leading editors to substitute verifiability, intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority. This would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to Wikipedia, once lauded as the place ``to come as you are,`` becoming stiff, purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding. This in turn carries into a discussion about public education, and the work that Carl Sagan is known to the general public for. Cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so. To me the posts in the disputed site I linked to are interesting (but that maybe just my own personal opinion) and Wikipedia users having them available is positive, constructive and enriching for Wikipedia, and that's the reason I linked to them in the first place. Throwing them out, all of them, seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things, the baby with the bath water, because a Wikipedia directive says so, just because it does, not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening, it would seem to me, not to exclude good things by statute. So the reliable source rules are something I would like to discuss a bit more at length.   `"
0,"MrRobP: I think this conversation honestly just boils down to a matter of opinion. I like Burton's Batman's too but i felt he changed so much as well to fit his gothic style. Just like Nolan changes a lot to fit his realism edge. I dont want ultra realism for all comic books i just feel it really works for Batman. Plus i like more mature movies and the darkness in this series really makes me believe that these people can exist out there. When i saw TDK, an aspect that made it so mezmerizing and great for me was that i can truly believe that a man like Ledger's Joker is out there somewhere, idk but it made the experience of that film so visceral. But that approach wouldnt work for Spiderman or\xa0 Avengers or basicallly all other superhero movies. Nolan's Batman gives the audience something no other superhero movie can give. One that can honestly happen, and that makes it more fantastical in my opinion."

No. Blacks who are from the Carribean or West Indies are Jamaican-American, Haitian-American, Trinidadian-American etc. As for the continent of Africa, it's a continent, not a country. It's a continent made up of over 50 countries. Look at List of African countries. They're nationalities are in the demographics link. Nationality refers to your country, not continent, of birth. A person from Nigeria is Nigerian. If that person becomes an American citizen, the person is Nigerian-American. Somalia to the United States: Somali-American. Ghana to the U.S.: Ghanaian-American.

By the way, why don't I here people like you criticizing the term Asian-American? Aren't Iraqis, Indians, Israelis, and Afghans Asian? Those countries are in the continent of Asia.

The university's own website (referenced in the article) does NOT say the change occurred in 1985, but rather 1986, and the school's website is also worded vaguely, such that one can reasonably surmise that the 1986 ``change`` was when some legal ``name-change`` was finalized, rather than when their actual usage of their ``name`` changed.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI recall this quite well, because I wrote and posted a ``Protest Poster`` at the dining hall during the fall '85 ``Parents' Weekend`` that specifically made a negative comparison between the (several years past) ``College of Steubenville`` and the (then current) ``University of Steubenville``. If the change occurred in 1985 (as the article says) or in 1986 (as the on-line reference the article cites says), then how could I have been making a distinction in my poster between the better, (and some years) past ``College`` and the [then] present, and not as good, ``University`` in the fall of 1985?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm not willing to devote any effort to fixing your ``encyclopedia`` by doing online research to fix the errors I know from personal experience.

now you deleted that template and i lost my template. 
please restore that work so I can reuse it. 
Also can you please explain why you deleted my template? How can I mark these pages?

thanks,

0,"`   ::::::It's a good suggestion. I would go a little further and offer this version of the entire paragraph that circumvents any mentioning of the 'claims':  ::::::``Although the empire had a multi-ethnic character during its history and preserved Romano-Hellenistic traditions, it became known to most of its western and northern contemporaries as the Empire of the Greeks due to the increasing predominance of the Greek element. The use of the term Empire of the Greeks (Latin: Imperium Graecorum) to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire also implied that in the West it was no longer seen as the Roman Empire. The authority of the Byzantine Emperor as successor of Roman Emperors, was challenged by the coronation of Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III in the year 800. Needing Charlemagne's support in his struggle against his enemies in Rome, Leo used the lack of a male occupant of the throne of the Eastern Roman Empire at the time to claim that it was vacant and that he could therefore crown a new Emperor himself. Whenever the Popes or the rulers of the West made use of the name Roman  to refer to the eastern Roman Emperors, they preferred the term Imperator Romaniæ instead of Imperator Romanorum, a title that Westerners maintained applied only to Charlemagne and his successors.``  ::::::I'd leave the last sentence though since it demonstrates that there was still a certain ambiguity about how Popes and other western rules saw the Byzantine Empire.  `"

 Your comment 

Your comment- Well, quite frankly, not everyone subscribes to that notion, and it is quite wrong of you and a handful of others to push your ideology onto people who hold a different opinion on the matter. There is simply no actual person named """"Chelsea Manning"""" here. What we have is a man named """"Bradley Manning"""" who wants to be called by this other name (and awhile ago it was reportedly """"Breanna"""") and referred to as """"she"""". That is all. That is the reality that the article should reflect, the policy of WP:COMMONNAME. Bradley Manning was a solider in the United States military. Bradley Manning was caught passing classified intel to unauthorized parties, convicted, and sentenced. After that, Bradley Manning decided to be called """"Chelsea"""". That is how the flow of the article should be, these are all things that a man named Bradley Manning did, you can't just flick a switch and rewrite history to say """"Chelsea Manning was convicted of violating the Espionage Act..."""" and so on. That just isn't historically accurate or truthful. When and if he legally changes his name, that is when the transition process of the article should begin. That all was simply way too soon.  I want you to know that I agree with you 100%. Your comment was one of, if not the best on the talk page. I just wanted to let you know.

For very well-known celebrities, the US government archives may have something: a Google image search on """"site:.gov"""" may bring something up.  Also, the search engine on the Archives website (http://www.archives.gov/) may find things that Google doesn't.  For people with military service, the military might have something (Google search on """"site:.mil"""").

For celebrities that were well-known before 1950, there may be newspaper photographs that have fallen out of copyright.  These will be hard to find, but the Library of Congress (http://www.loc.gov/) may have something.

A further option is to contact the celebrity's agent or estate and ask for an image to be released under GFDL, Creative Commons attribution, or Creative Commons sharealike-attribution licenses.

In my opinion, if free-use images can't be found, the second-best choice is a promotional photo: it's an image that is intended to be distributed widely.  Of course, there are exceptions: for albums, singles, and DVDs, a low-resolution scan of the cover is always appropriate.  For movies, a still from a well-known scene or a low-resolution scan of a promotional poster is good.  Failing all else, other fair-use images can be used, but they need to be tagged, justified, have the source/copyright owner credited, and used very sparingly.

As for the images at Iron Maiden, I'm still trying to figure out how strict I should be about fair-use images: all the images there are directly related to the subject of the article (except Image:PrisonerNovel.jpg, which I've just removed), all of them have some semblance of a source indicated, all of them have some semblance of a fair-use justification, and none of them seem to be surplus to the needs of the article.  I should probably push to have the justifications be made more explicit.  """

 == Yamaga == 

 Mr. Yamaga  	 Thank you very much. The first of the new shows is called Mahoromatic. This series is based on an original comic and we made 12 episodes for this show. Since the comic book series is not quite over... there are going to be 14 more episodes and that is going to be the end of the anime. 

 AQ  	 Is Mahoromatic cel based? 
 Mr. Yamaga  	 It is cel based and it will be the last one. Originally when the project came to be, I thought that it was still possible to make cel animation. However, it is getting harder and harder to find people who will paint the cels and people who will film the cels. It seems like the industry is going more and more toward computers and it is getting harder and harder to make cel animation.  	  

 Mr. Akai  	 The first series was on cels and it was filmed on 35 millimeter prints, kind of like feature films, but the second season is going to be on computers. 
 AQ  	 Will this cause a big difference in the look of the series or is it going to have the same basic style? 
 Mr. Akai  	 As long as you are watching it on television, it is not going to make a big difference. It might actually get slightly better. If you are watching it on a large screen, then you will be able to tell a difference. [Ed note: Large screen=movie screen] 

 http://web.archive.org/web/20031205021525/http://anime-tourist.com/article.php?sid=298 

 AT  	 A couple of questions about Mahoromatic: Where does the second season pick up in the story? 
 Mr. Yamaga  	 In the comic book series, the first season covered up to the third book. The second season will pick up from the beginning of the fourth volume. However, the Tv series has surpassed the comic book in its speed and the Tv series is going to end before the comic book. The author has said that you can't really end it in the same way, you just cant. So the later half of the second season is going to be very different from the comic book. 
  	 In fact, Gainax itself has not been given the details of the way that the comic is going to go. So we are kind of .. trying to find our way in the dark. 
 AT  	 What was it about the Mahoromatic story that said to you, """"This is going to make a great animation. People are really going to want to watch this?"""" 
 Mr. Yamaga  	 Originally, Pioneer had brought the comic book to us and presented the series. We did not really look at it very carefully. We realized that it was a particular genre called the Maid genre. We hadn't done that yet and it seemed a little bit interesting, so we decided to make Mahoromatic. 

  
 http://web.archive.org/web/20040101025405/http://www.anime-tourist.com/article.php?sid=299 

  
 AQ  	 The ending of Mahoromatic has a very enjoyable dance video sequence. Did you come up with that using live dancers? 
 Mr. Yamaga  	 Actually, I came up with it at night and just kind of figured it out. I felt very silly when I'm did it at night. I did a little bit and wrotes it down, did a little bit more and wrote it down. That is kind of how it was made. [Ed note: Its our impression that he acted it out, which is why he felt silly doing it.] 
 AQ  	 I found it kind of interesting how the ending song of Mahoromaticwas like advertising. Did you write the lyrics? 
 Mr. Yamaga  	 Actually, I did not write the lyrics myself. Somebody else wrote the lyrics. 
  	 Any other questions?

A. On the Myth section, you've kind of got stuff at both the front and at the beginning that contrasts versus Ovid. 

1. I would move that stuff you have on top of Ovid that is comparisons and then put it down integrated into the later section. cut the summary of the summaries (nuke that).  So it would go 2 equals Myth, no writing, 3 equals Ovid, then 3 equals other myths

2.  Within  Ovid, maybe add some comment about Metamorphoses being wildly popular (RS avail in wiki article for that) at the time and that Ovid;s version is has become the familiar version of t

he myth to present day people.  Then all the story telling.

3.  I like how you've got more meat in Other versions.  But take it even a step further.  Give me some dates.  Let me know if any of the versions were known to have influenced each other or Ovid (don't explain a negative, but if there is anyhing mentione it.  And discuss all the differences in story (you have that).

B.  Not perfect, but would stick the Guardian comment in Interprectation, at beginning or end.  It's commentary on the myth, not literature.

C.  I like the in-article discussion of myrrh.  You will get some who kvetch, but the two are so linked and the term so strange to the modern ear.  I might move all the myrrh stuff except the Latin name (so the Biblical notes and acnient usage) and stick it at the end of etymology and origin.  Follows well after the myrrh-Myrrha word linkage.  And explains the substance a little earlier in article (so doing more good).  Only bad thing is you lose the connection to the image of myrrh.  could just switch back to lady bug though.  donno if there is a way to fit two images in that tiny Origins section.  you do have pics of the tree anyhow in the form of her transformation.

D.  There are some things I remember missing now.  If that is intentional, editorially fine. 

E. Prob needs a new logic edit.  and new copyedit."

All other things being equal we should use newer versions (though many contain commentaries so can be construed as secondary). But Bede seems to have been messed with over the years. Particularly, you'll find there appears to be a lacuna in all versions - Bede promises to return to ``the siege of Badon-hill, when they made no small slaughter of those enemies, about forty-four years after their arrival in England. But of this hereafter.`` And ``hereafter`` never comes: what comes is the only loss of temporal sequence in the book. So this is why comprehensive secondary sources are needed. Anyhow, I am not going to try to impose some novel reading but on the other hand I accept that Martin of Tours was a soldier, Germanus led an army, Patrick's mission was accompanied by a Saxon fleet (Annals of Ulster) - I do not want to suppress this information in the service of an unrealistically sweetened picture of these Christian saints either. So this is why I am wary of the idea that those British bishops were dedicated to ``Romanism`` - in fact the British invented all this ``Joseph of Arimathea`` stuff purely in order to claim an apostolic succession that did NOT involve Rome. In this context I find it significant that David was made Archbishop in Jerusalem - and that this western Archbishopric has completely disappeared!   `"

My assessment is that the page is up for deletion because it doesn't contain any reliable sources; arm's-length, third-party expert sources that assert the notability of the subject in a verifiable way.  That would be things like articles about the organization in magazines and newspapers.  In addition, although I am slightly familiar with the situation with respect to York University and the Chiropractic College, I looked and found that there is no evidence in Wikipedia articles about those organizations that backs up your assertion of Skeptics Canada's involvement in that situation.  If you could find specific reliable sources to back up that assertion, that would be very useful in bolstering the group's notability; as well, it would be useful to insert material into the articles about the two organizations that links them to your group's article, etc.  Note that, if the article is ``speedy deleted``  which is likely to happen in the very near future  I can assist you by retrieving the deleted content and placing it into what we call a ``sandbox`` page where you can work on it to add the kinds of reliable sources I've mentioned.

Memorandum for the President (discussing behavior of the Shah, Gen. Zahedi and Winston Churchill immediately after the coup), Memorandum from the Department of State, top secret, circa August 1953

Prior to the 1979 hostage-taking episode, the most contentious issue in U.S.-Iran relations was the 1953 coup against Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq, which the CIA and British intelligence helped to instigate. Numerous questions remain about the coup itself, its impact, and the circumstances which brought it about. To what extent was Mossadeq leading his country down the path toward communist subversion? Could the coup have succeeded without substantial Iranian public dissatisfaction with Mossadeq’s policies? Did key Iranian political and religious figures, wittingly or not, receive CIA payments in return for stirring up the population? What effects did the coup have on the future development of internal Iranian politics, including possibly radicalizing anti-Shah and anti-American opposition elements with consequences that would not be foreseen until the revolution itself?

The search for answers will have to wait at least until more of the documentary record is available in both Iran and the United States. Unfortunately, a portion of the record on the American side will never be recovered because CIA operatives, according to former Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey, destroyed them in the 1960s. The surviving files remain locked away from public view on the grounds that their declassification, even 46 years later, would damage the national security. Because of the obvious public interest value and historical significance of these materials, the National Security Archive in May 1999 filed suit against the CIA to demand their release. The suit is still pending."

0,"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Nothing about recombination ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is ridiculous that all focus is dedicated on how animals select a partner that in 100 kb text we cannot even afford a note on why do they do that in the first place. Ok, male expose higher mutation rate and thus expose higher variability: most of the men are defected whereas others are extremely cute. They can spread they genes as hell and best features can be conserved in women, who undergo much less mutation and exist solely to conserve best genes (best trials, aka best men). This was said in the article, albeit not pronounced clearly. Better exposition of this part would shed some light on why do we have men and women in the first place. It would be even better to say something about recombination. Recombination, aka sexual reproduction or crossover is what allows to combine best features from different individuals. It makes evolution much faster than single individual mutation. Just imagine: one guy fortunately acquires one feature, another guy acquires another feature, third guy acquires some another feature. Now, if they cannot recombine and exchange their knowledge, they have to discover everything themselves. On the other hand, “If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.” Bernard Shaw explains the recombination principle: The human culture has advanced so rapidly just because you could spread the knowledge for free (I am not talking about climate in Wikipedia). Imagine that you had to discover everything yourself. You would still live in a cave age. So, recombination, sexual reproduction, is extreemly powerful. The flirt affairs sucked around is not as closely crucial. Why cannot we have even a reference to the recombination?   "

For example, if I were capable of editing the Articles for deletion page that he just created, I would note that the film has been covered in all sorts of notable sources, like:

...to name just a few.  I would also point out that several notable people were involved with the film, like the VERY notable Tuli Kupferberg, who stars in it.

But I can't edit the page because I'm blocked right now, and he nominated the article for deletion again only after you blocked me - because he wanted to make sure I couldn't edit the Articles for deletion page.

0,"`NEWLINE_TOKEN::::  A 20 year monopoly on the American comic book industry is nothing to sneeze at.—yes, it is.  The focus of the article is on the comics medium, not on one tiny timespan of one tiny corner of the comics world.  The American comic book industry in the last twenty years is a tiny speck—in American comic books there's a whole long history that predates that, much of which is far more significant; the American comic strip industry has always been economically and historically larger; graphic novels have been taking over, and they've been growing outside the direct market and Diamond; and the American comics industry as a whole is dwarfed by those of Europe and Japan.  The Diamond monopoly is significant only to the American comic book industry of the last twenty years, and therefore merits mention in American comic book.  Outside of that article, it is unbalanced and irrelevant fluff.  It astounds me how you can't understand how ridiculously out of scope this is.  🍁  `"

0,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Thanks for helping to lift the veil on Verbal - More questions ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENElonka - I understand that Verbal did not block me, but is it true that he had nothing to do with it? I am normally much more than civil. I have often been complemented on my diplomacy and tact, but this user's approach to editing seems overly aggressive and not helpful enough. It seems to me that Verbal is abusing his position. Let me give a simple example. There were many edits made to the page in question with much valid data. Verbal simply deleted them with the cryptic note about them being non-notable (nn), or RS (or similar). This does nothing to help those who were attempting to improve the page. There is a term for this kind of bullying when one in the know smacks down new users without giving appropriate guidance. On the page in question. There were dozens of books listed with ISBN numbers. Is that not verifiable enough? If that is inappropriate, what is the 'proper' way to cite books? At the very least his reverts are ham-handed and trashed many valid and verifiable items along with a few that were unverified. How is that helpful? Verbal's standard seems to be if the reference includes a link to another existing Wikipedia page, then it is acceptable. Some of those pages are not sufficiently verifiable themselves. Given Verbal's aggressive approach, why not delete those other pages for lack of verifiability as well? I appreciate your guidance and assistance. I will do my best to bring the deleted content up to the standards once I understand them and once I have a contact like yourself to help keep an eye on Verbal who refused to respond to my previous inquiries. I will use my logged in credentials when I feel I am safe from being abused by Verbal's overly aggressive approach. I do not want to lose my account. He refuses to help or answer valid questions. He simply deletes entries with terse edit summaries. He's not helpful in teaching newer users what he is seeking. That's not what I understood was the helpful nature of the Wikipedia community. Look at all the credentials on his page. It's quite clear that he's an ego maniac. The more credentials, the lower the self-esteem, IMO.  I question whether all of those credentials are even valid. Are they subject to any verification process? Would there be any censure if he were found to be overstating his resume? Thanks for letting me vent. I just believe in being clear, in communicating, and in helping people to learn to be better Wikipedia contributors.```"

Trolling

Please check with me before assuming bad faith, because """"as far as you can see"""" isn't far enough at this moment. I suggest you look here, here and here (and there's more where those came from), for the trolling from a certain editor. He's shown repeatedly he has no respect for policy, so I'm not wasting my time explaining a policy I've already linked to when he'll just ignore it and say """"IAR"""". I'd told him to stay off my talk page, and he posted there again. He's a troll, and I'll remove trolling because it is trolling. You're responding to trolls now even being here over absolutely nothing. I could find you dozens of similar examples from certain editors each day, but when they were brought here previously you did nothing so I'm not wasting my time or yours when you'll do nothing.

 *For the paragraph based on Almonte's journal, is that the historical analysis of the journal or Almonte's own words.  I'm not comfortable citing directly to a primary source.  Lindley also mentioned that Almonte used that number (although not the detail in that paragraph), so we could cite to him if we need to. 
 *I don't think we need the details of Damacio Jimenez in the lead 

 I actually had a different vision of the lead.  I would have structured it similarly to this: 
 *How people got there 
 **Mexico besieged the Alamo beginning Feb 23.  At the time, there were X number of Texians garrisoned there.  Some of the men who were out doing stuff weren't able to re-enter because of Mexican troops; others did. 
 **Travis sent letters - lots of letters - asking for reinforcements.  Members of the garrison were sent out as couriers to deliver them.  
 **Purported amnesty and the Tejanos left too (I think I read somewhere that they were trying to protect their families/property) 
 **Volunteers were gathering in Gonzales to try to reinforce the mission.  32 made it in on March 1. 
 **Fannin, leader of the other garrison in Texas, attempted to reinforce the mission; made it 2 miles and turned back 
 **some of Fannin's men, some of the couriers, and others who wanted to join the effort attempted to reinforce the mission on March 4.  Approximately 50 made it inside; the others were turned back by Mexican troops 
 **Mexican troops launched an all-out assault on March 6 and killed almost all of the defenders in the Alamo at that time.  
 *How many were there? 
 **Almonte's numbers 
 **Telegraph and Texas Register list compiled 
 **Ruiz 
 **Military land grants used muster rolls and sworn statements of witnesses. Lindley has some of this, Lack may have more 
 **There was an 1881 monument that had a list of names.  It burned down. No record of who was on that list. I will have to think on where I saw that information. 
 **First comprehensive historical look at the names was Amelia Williams' doctoral dissertation, where she identified 182 names.  These were used for the official list on the Alamo Cenotaph erected in 1936 
 **Later historians have cast doubts on the accuracy of Williams' list, finding some people on the list who were not defenders and finding other omissions. 
 **Research continues to be done and there is likely never going to be a definitive count"

0,""" 

 I'm an African-American, and I find the objections to the illustration completely over-the-top.   The illustration accurately depicts the characteristics of the classic  not universal  """"Negroid"""" phenotype.  Dolichocephalic skulls are a classic feature of the Africoid phenotype.   

 Are there similarities between the skulls of the classic Africoid/Negroid phenotype and certain simians/primates?  Insofar as, in some instances, a pronounced prognathism and a dolichocephalic skull  yes, absolutely.  And the same can be said of flattened, rounded European skulls with regard to other simian/primate species.  So what?  The fact that such similarities in the case of Africoid populations have been used in the past to dehumanize and slander black folks has nothing to do with objective observation.  The fact is the illustration is dead-on accurate  not as a representation of all Africoid populations  but as an illustration of the phenotypical features which most distinctively differentiate fundamentally unmiscegenated Africoid populations from other human populations. 

 The only Caucasians (other than the East Indian Veddoid group, which incorrectly and calculatingly has been classified as """"Caucasian"""", though they're as black Africoid as the Australoids and Nilotics) known as a group to have dolichocephalic skulls are Nordics.  The classic Caucasian skull would not apply to them, either; but taken collectively and regarded generally, the phenotype of the classic Caucasian skull is as accurate, generally, as its Africoid counterpart.  Maxillary and alveolar prognathisms are also classic features of the Africoid phenotype, a feature which often results in a receding chin line.  These collection of classic Africoid features is precisely the same set of characteristics which clearly reveal the mummy of King Tutankhamen as black African, rather than """"Caucasoid North African,"""" as was recently claimed in the shameful (and ongoing) whitewashing of ancient dynastic Egypt by Zawas and the usual lying, racist European suspects.  

 IMO, black folks need to get real and stop being so damned sensitive and reactionary.  F*** the racists and deal with the facts.  We can't on one hand use the phenotypical model to identify long-dead black African kings and then repudiate their fundamental accuracy and cry """"racism"""" on another.   """

0,"`  == Georg Büchner Prize ==  Hi, thanks for the addition. The problem with this one is the prize amount since the list has a cut off of $100,000. There are a few under that amount since exchange rates could conceivably bring them up into the list. But for the Büchner Prize would require the Euro to trade at 2:1 to the dollar which is almost inconceivable, the highest its ever been was around 1.5 and currently under 1.25. The alternative is to reduce barrier for entry into the list, but even at 100,000 I think there are too many to be considered ``richest``. There are tons more in the 50-100 range which would make the list (even more) arbitrary.   `"

0,"`Pseudoscience Category ==  I feel strongly that this article should be moved away from the pseudoscience category, as it does fulfill any of WIkipedia's requirements of pseudoscience. Wikipedia states:  Other things usually should not be called pseudoscience on Wikipedia:  Alternative theoretical formulations: Alternative theoretical formulations from within the scientific community, such as Modified Newtonian Dynamics as opposed to dark matter, are not pseudoscience, but part of the scientific process. Such theoretical formulations may fail to explain some aspect of reality, but, should they succeed in doing so, will usually be rapidly accepted. For instance, the theory of continental drift had quite a lot of evidence, but was heavily criticised because there was no known mechanism for continents to move, and thus such evidence was dismissed. When such a mechanism was discovered, it became mainstream as plate tectonics.  To determine whether something falls into the category of pseudoscience or merely an alternative theoretical formulation, consider this: Alternative theoretical formulations generally tweak things on the frontiers of science, or deal with strong, puzzling evidence which it is difficult to explain away, in an effort to create a model that better explains reality. Pseudoscience generally proposes changes in basic scientific laws or reality in order to allow some phenomenon which the supporters want to believe occurs, but lack the strong scientific evidence that would justify such major changes. Pseudoscience usually relies mainly on weak evidence, such as anecdotal evidence or weak statistical evidence at just above the level of detection, though it may have a few papers with positive results, for example: parapsychology and homeopathy.  ``AIDS denialists`` are not proposing a new form of science based on non-scientific methods, they are merely disputing that the claims that other scientists make, and these disputes arise ENTIRELY from science. In fact, ``AIDS denialists`` claim that MAINSTREAM scientists are not using science correctly. In fact, all they are doing is asking for scientific proof of what the mainstream scientific community insists exists but can't verify.      == `"

I'm not sure that's the example you meant (the diff shows a """"Defendent"""" -> """"Defendant"""" change; """"Defendent"""" is either a typo or a Briticism, and shouldn't be used in reference to a US legal case, where the term of art is """"Defendant"""" (and we'd only capitalize it like that in titles of cases).

0," About Dr. Archika Indian Master Dr. Archika is a modern day Meditation Master, Yoga researcher, nutritionist, rationalist, motivator, soul healer, visionary and metaphysicist. This iconic master is also one of the most renowned spiritual innovators of all the times. She has attained the highest goal of human life by being enlightened as she has been practicing numerous yoga and meditation techniques under the most able and renowned masters of India. Being a doctor and a scientist by profession, she presents to the world a perfect blend of both spirituality and science; hence her sessions are scientifically spiritual. Archika means ‘Complete Devotion or a deep meditator who whole heartedly submits to the will of Divinity’. As her spiritual name suggests, along with her imbibing the meaning into her personality, she encourages East and West to completely delve into the depths of their soul, to explore the boundaries of their heart and to discover the nature of their mind. Her aim is of “Spiritually Healthy Living” (Health for all the five bodies: Physical, Pranic, Mental, Intellectual and Spiritual) and thereby making the soul healthy to completely actualize its divine powers. She amicably teaches this abstract concept in a very practical and factual manner attracting seekers around the globe.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe BeginningNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENComing from a family of rich values and dedication, Dr. Archika has chosen a path of meditation, yoga and philanthropy. She is a blessed and extraordinary person as she has learned meditation and lessons of spirituality from her renowned father, Guru and a Saint of highest authority, His Holiness Sudhanshuji Maharaj. After completing her studies in dentistry and realizing the fact that stress is also responsible for some of the dental problems, numerous health issues, and further observing the unhealthy and stressful lifestyle of people and their unawareness about the ultimate goal of life, she got inspired to work on this path.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn Mid Life of TodayNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhat makes this meditation master unique is her all-encompassing knowledge in the fields necessary to make one mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually healthy. Having thoroughly researched the Science of Inner Transformation, she is a highly accomplished meditator and scientist who have mastered Human Science, Yogic Science, Food Science, Alternative Medicines and Dentistry. The degrees of Doctorate in ‘Alternative Medicines’ and ‘Yogic Sciences’ are additional feathers in her cap of exemplary achievements at such a young age. With love and fresh insights into the timeless wisdom, she offers the ultimate truth in a simple manner. She rekindles that missing spark- the spark of awareness that makes us catch hold of the lost chord that brings us closer to ourselves. She has always been aspired to impart her treasured knowledge to the masses so that they can enhance their health and spiritual development. In the league of this thought, she developed a Divine Entity called Dr. Archika Meditation and graced that with transformation tools: Sound Therapy, Pranic Food, Yogic Kriyas and Scientific Methods. She has further devised various meditation and relaxation techniques such as Powerful Silence Meditation, Neurobiological Meditation, Prana Urja Meditation etc. for a modern man to enable him to live in a peaceful way devoid of any worries or stresses.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo far many International Scientific Meditation Retreats in Dubai, United States, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Canada and around 150 meditation sessions across India have been organized benefiting a number of people. Many diet and nutrition workshops have remained a constant part of the sessions. She also council’s sadhaks who come looking for answers to their spiritual quest. She further includes question and answer rounds and short lectures in her retreats and camps on the topics ranging from Meditation, Spirituality to their effects on human body and Science, thereby bridging the gap between the two. Dr. Archika, through the symphonic reproduction of tones, imitation of gesticulations and modes of actions, and an appropriate representation of situations which is termed as ‘Emotional Response’ leads to the realm of bliss that springs from the enjoyment of sentiments through MEDITATION.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENShe is the youngest receiver of the PRESIDENT AWARD- DINKAR SAHITYA RATAN by theNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENhonorable President of India Shri.

I encourage TB to STOP these comparisons involving Peter Roskam, who by all accounts is a fine Christian man, and Willy Horton! If this continues I'm gonna have to go to BLP! If Tbeatty needs to compare Roskam and somebody else, I suggest he stick to other GOP politicians, not a convicted a rapist/murderer. (who never even held office)! I collegially suggest to my friend Tbeatty that he pick Tom Delay, Bob Ney, or Randy 'Duke' Cunningham for comparative purposes! (Willy Horton's probably a Dem anyway!) -  "

 Paragraphs vs section headers 

Sorry, didn't mean to imply it didn't have """"merit"""", any good faith edit on Wikipedia has merit. What I'm saying is, section breaks and paragraph breaks are similar, the question is when to use one vs the other. Paragraph breaks provide logical breaks in the content. In this case there is a new section header at the top of almost every paragraph, which is redundant, that's what paragraphs are made for. By adding those section headers, I believe, it chops up the article which discourages reading it as a single block of text from top to bottom, and encourages skimming and skipping, like reading an outline that hasn't been filled in, or a """"list of"""" sort of thing, rather than a chronological and somewhat inter-related history of the origin of the high five. If we thought those origin theories were going to be greatly expanded.. say 4 or 5 or more paragraphs each.. I could see section headers making more sense, but until then, I believe it reads better as a single block of text. Green Cardamom (talk) 
I see what you're saying, but I disagree. I think it looks better the way it is now, especially with the long block quote in the first section. I mean, the other option to me is bullets, but I think we both would agree that's not that aesthetically pleasing. Without some kind of division, it makes it harder to see that the three options are mutually exclusive, or arose independently at best. Without the divisions, in my opinion, it sounds like one origin narrative that all together led to the high five, rather than three separate possibilities.   """

0,"Okay. I was giving suggestions for the article before, but people began attacking me. So I defended myself. But they did not get a warning. But regardless, I think that the current article is very good. Maybe it can be broadened up to include the various definitions the term Islamism takes from different people. Very differnt definitions are applied to the term as shown in the sources. I also think that the history section should be removed. It lists Islamic groups as Islamist movements based on opinion and it has nothing to do with the term. I think that the history section should focus more on the evolution of the term. The different stages it went through, for example, the term was first used in french to just refer to Islam. Then the term disappeared. Then during the 1970s people began using that term to refer to what they refered to as 'political Islam.' Then Daniel Pipes popularized the usage of the term.   The article should also include a controversy sectio nabout how controverisal the use of the term is. That is my take on it.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN"

I can give some examples:  The hacking community was also infuriated by his habit of making the latest hacking developments public, with his publication of technical details on phone phreaking earning him top spots on the “Most Hated Person” charts in the Worldcharts diskmag for several years.  That is truely an amazing version of the story. If you read these discmags the title ``most hated person`` came from rumors that Kim Schmitz had denunciatet many members of the BBS scene. Since this version is not citeable neither should be in the article.   His legal team maintained that this was not insider trading as the information did not come from anybody else and Schmitz had created the business opportunity himself. “I think the outcome would be different in a court of law today as the Internet bubble had just burst at the time, everyone had lost a lot of money and there was so much media attention that I became the scapegoat,” Schmitz maintained.  Where does this statement come from? Why is that relevant?  Schmitz later conceded he had been young, stupid, naïve and aggressive. “I had no idea about the legal implications of my actions,” he acknowledged. “I hope my mistakes can therefore serve as an example for young entrepreneurs. They should remember one golden rule be careful and always think twice about what you are doing.”  This is a sentence for an autobiography, not an Wikipedia article.  Schmitz, who has also long been a fan of Formula I and organised several big parties for the races in Monaco, now plans to develop a racetrack and is currently scouting potential sites around the world.  Future plans without any details have nothing to do with Wikipedia. He can announce this on his own home page.   `"

It's great that you have a different opinion, life would be boring if we all agreed (!), but the fact that we can be accurate here should probably be the base level at which we consider this. Personal preference and likes and dislikes aside, and looking at a discussion in an objective sense, factual accuracy alone would be enough for me to call it.

Their main target is to distort all articles lelated to  ISLAM, TURKEY, REBUBLIC OF MACEDONIA, BULGARIA, ALBANIA (CHAMERIA), THEIR MINORITIES IN GREECE AND THEIR HISTORY. They attack  every article criticizing Greece transforming it  to Greekish propaganda POV. They became maniacs in optimizing dark side of Greek history.They communicate each other by secret e-mails avoiding messages through their talk pages to avoid publicity. This group acting in a systematic way to revert articles, when one of member makes the limit of 3 reverts, one another continues with 4th revert to avoid punishment for violating 3rv rule.  Furthermore they are suspected agents of Greek National Intelligence Service (E.Y.Π. Κυπατζήδες) and  believers of ultra nationalistic organizations of Greek “national interests”, as L.A.O.S. and Chrissi Avgi. They are also multiple sockpuppets and impersonators of their group members. They are all schizophrenics web vandals unacceptible to wikipedian community. Balkan history has labelled such people as GREKOMANS, a form of mental malignacy cited in Larousse dictionaries. Their illusion is MEGALI IDEA of Greek nationalism-expandism.They have been allied with Armenian, Serbian and Cypriot extremists of similar interest. THEY HAVE CONSTITUTED A WIKIPEDIAN GUNG, A GREEK PRAPAGANDA LOBBY, A GREEK EPSILON TEAM. All member of group are very radical nationalists. They work continously in three shifts over day and night.

 Comments on Talk:Ashurism 

Hi Elias.  You made a few comments on the above talk page, such as """"Damn Garzo, no offence, and I do mean this in a positive way, but you're truly a pain in the ass )"""", """"You are obviously, like most Wikipedians, an enemy of Freedom of Speech, you have issues with someone questioning your motives, and you are also a hypocrite"""", and """"That's really, because you are an old man, Garzo. You know, a little stiff. Again, no offence, but you should stop taking yourself too seriously, you know, be a little bit more humble. """".  While none of these are, taken in context, especially offensive, your tone was flippant and unhelpful (and bordering on rude in the second example, with some unfair accusations of racism also made).  

I don't want to have to block you again as you're clearly a bright and valuable contributor for the most part, but please try and bear in mind the feelings of others - not everyone may share your sense of humour on what is ostensibly a scholarly project, and calling your fellow editors """"pain in the ass"""", """"racist"""", """"hypocrite"""" or """"old man"""" is rude, no matter how many times you say """"no offence"""" or add smileys to the end of the sentence.

There are zero examples of symmetrical collapse from fires, impact damage, or anything besides contolled demolition.  Achieving symmetry in a building collapse requires that all of the vertical supports fail at the same time, or a least fail in an evenly spaced, symmetrical manner. The odds of this happening by chance are very small, especially considering the impact damage and fires were asymmetrical.

0,": Unusually (I think uniquely) this bell was worn in UK service, not just collected during a tour of North America.  
 : The loco was built as Woodcock. In 1937, part of the coronation of George VI celebrations was the LNER's Coronation express service. This was hauled by new-build A4s with garter blue livery and stainless trim. Several A4s were renamed with names to commemorate the Commonwealth nations - this was a relatively new concept at the time, having only been formed a few years earlier as the old British Empire began to reorganise. 4489 only ran for a month or so before renaming,  The new Dominions (Two Dominions, one Union, one Commonwealth and an Empire) were quite positive about these changes at the time (India less so) and joined in the celebrations. The CPR donated a chime whistle to this project, and after a few years the bell to go with it. 
 : The bell lasted under the '50s BR rebuilds, when a double chimney was fitted. With no space available, the bell was removed and stored. In the '60s she was donated to the Canadian museum and the bell went overseas too. As she was never restored in Canada (as had been planned) and the chimney was still a double, there was nowhere to put the bell. 
 : Supposedly she survived withdrawal from BR by the narrowest of margins. Gresley pacifics, being three cylindered, were difficult to tow as scrap as the middle cylinder connecting rod needed to be dropped first. This was impossible in situ and had to be done over a pit - or else with a gas axe. By some mix up this hadn't been done immediately and she sat for too long to be moved again without serious fitter attention. So she sat for even longer and longer (there was no shortage of easier steam locos to be shipped off first), getting overgrown by brambles in some Rev Awdry fashion. She even outlived Darlington shed itself. One day platelayers arrived to start lifting the old metals of the steam shed, only to find there was a gurt hefty A4 left sat on them, hiding in the bushes! While the matter was decided between whether to haul it out or to chop in situ, someone thought to palm it off on the Canadians instead.  On the way to the docks she stopped at Crewe to have a few missing bits re-attached from other scrapped A4s and a repaint with an inappropriate can of brunswick green that happened to be open at the time. Which is about as far as the Candians ever got with restoration for the next 40 years.  Only with the big reunion restoration in the UK (which needed a lot of body filler and T cut) the chimney went back to a single and the bell was refitted."

0,"` February 2009 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::* Well, hope the floor didn't hurt. But your characterization of my attitude and what I respect and don't is to say the least dubious. Did it occur to you that I didn't attend your schools, have different experiences, different parents, and can think for myself? There is plenty of room for differences in interpretation, as anyone that has mediated flame wars here, as I have can tell you. One cranky old editor spouting off does NOT make for a battle. OTOH, similar frank opinions have almost universally in the past resulted in a good working relationship, a clear communication, and about 3/4ths of the time, resulted in a new Wikifriend. So piffle to WP:CIVyou're not looking at the context, nor the intent of the context for that guideline. Being polite can in fact be counterproductive and a time waste, a matter of judgmentmine, as the observer. Take Quiddity (who signed up at page top for example) who once demonstrated a unbelievable tendency to pro-offer unwarranted judgments and unsolicited advice. Ultimately, I had to get firm with him and sent this, which he threatened to post, SO I DID. Nothing there to be ashamed of, you see. Bottom line... there are some people in this world that need rapped along side the ear to get their attention. There are others that need to have their toes stepped on, UNTIL THEY APOLOGIZE. Both those types benefit some by being jerked up by the shorthairs. Failing all else, it makes me feel better, and communicates at least one person, however crazy they may think me, has less than steller appreciation for their actions as they impact othersnormally others time. I really don't get excised much here about anything else. Endless editing and all that, after all.Sooooo, Thanks for the appeal to my vanity, but I suggest in the future you counsel people to examine whether a situation is ongoing, escalating, or one time episode of venting. I spent 2-1/2 years here acting as a mediator myself, and would never have considered involving myself in an isolated message based case. Not sensible. Call it justifiable road rage if you like—a real world situation here in cyber space, and  at least I cleaned up the vulgarity of what I had written in the first three drafts, to make my loathing judgment of his lazy rape of hundreds of pages plain. THAT is where I put my loyalty and focus. NOT on one of thousands of arguable interpretation of various guidelines and policies. If your INTERPRETATION of WP:CIV prohibits any colorful idiom or addressing a dumbshit-thing-to-do as a dumbshit act, I'm definitely done here. I'm floored that you haven't the imagination to understand that— save for the hyperbole about kicking ass, a deliberate attempt to indicate how poorly I viewed the 5-6 hours a day of well over six weeks of effort fixing his rape pogrom allegedly following guidelines — nor the fact that you were all being busy-bodies making much ado about nothing. One of the most reprehensible facts about contributing here is that there is a total insensitivity to the leisure time our contributors make, particularly by 'blithely accepting actions', one way or another, deleting their hard work and effort, which is about as personal an attack as one can make... Show me where NPA THE LEAST SENSITIVE to that VERY REAL, VERY PERSONAL virtual 'slap in the face'.  And fools wonder why we have editor retention rate problems! Wake the fuck up. THAT IS A REAL WORLD PROBLEM, not my slight episode of 'hitting' to administer a lesson in courtesy to others. (Call me twisted, but a single discourtesy to me  administered to make the point is properly due those who exercise the ultimate discourtesies, really without due process. Making 180 article pages into redirects without involving the community at large in the decision is to me, WP:BOLD applied way over the top. AFD or MFD should have been invoked, at the least. Not one talk page and three or four editors without a direct attempt to re-involve the originator of same articles, or their major contributors. BOTH THOSE badly need a quorum count provision, but I digress, the digression.) Those articles nearly 200 some were something apparently dozens put up... involving hundreds of man-hours and were well crafted. Oh, they needed some cites for a few fannish statements of cause and effect, but the necessity of that is itself doubtful in cultural articles about recently produced intellectual efforts. WP:AGF should be sufficient for such a report making a statement like ``this is the first (last) episode character/actor-so-and-so appeared in, and so forth. Then there's the whole joke of notability for such pages, which is hands down the most destructive guideline I've seen passed here. It's net result, because of the plethora of WP:NOTE guidelines, is we've literally lost thousands of editors by taking away their prime motivations for becoming involved, and applying inappropriate measures in an 'alleged' attempt to improve the quality of our offered articles—merely because some too wedded to the academic world have dictated the (anti-commonsensical) need of quoting a writer about something, rather than readily available source material. Others agreed, because like myself, they disdain one media or the other (I have no use for rock bands, and most TVbut at least I understand my prejudices) and felt that such has little place in an educational project—in direct controvention to statement's Jimbo has made lauding such breadth of coverage. The failure to improve overall article quality in the two years since is manifold and obvious; GA, FA and B-Class articles haven't notably increased in either numbers or percentages. The manpower drain to such measures of deletionism (vice improvement of whatever to a reasonable 'type-standard') has really gone nowhere. OTOH, ANYONE can access a primary source in a cultural matter like a popular book or television program (albeit with some effort required) to check a fact, cite a quote, or check an interpretation or summation, synopsis or summary. Cultural topic coverage is some of the more entertaining reading we offer, after all, and those that punch in random article or just hear about someone/something new is something that attracts readers. So who should care that such articles aren't to an academic standard. They don't need to bethe reader wants information and coverage, not null search results...  In DIRECT CONTRAST to WP:NOTE's focus is the indisputable fact that today, many people come to wikipedia FIRST, not just via google, to get a laydown on a cultural topic. My teens were the one's who made this obvious to me. They checked things out here first... then google in many cases. The third party source and so called notability guidelines are frigging idiotic as written for fictional matters.  But I get more satisfaction arguing with a wall. I guess you picked up some of my disdain for those ramifications and the narrow interpretations by some... but do remember, IAR trumps them.  That those editors apparently had moved on, perhaps found the contributory environment here too hostile, and weren't around to defend those pages became too patently plain if you examine the talk record... One idiot lemming behavior one sees over and over here is some young editor, from my pov 'much lacking life's perspective and experience' latches onto the language of some guideline  or guidelines and gets carried away with ittotally discounting the effort of others to build whatever page or trying to make it work. Had he accessed some off site materials (The scripts are on the web, for example), incorporated important series evolutionary trivia into the articles, and eliminated the fan trivia, the pages would have been easy to fix up. Instead, I saw it on my sickbed, queried our coverage an got appalled. I did however thank him for his screw up helped me get interested in the show, and I'm usually disdainful of entertainment media overall if it's not between book covers. The show's rather well done and enjoyable. My first wife, may she rest in peace, was a wiccan and I've been quite interested in comparing wiccan depictions these last 28 years. The miracle is not that I went so easy on that SOB, nor (to some) threatened violence, but that I bite my tounge for months without saying something—then had to spout when he made yet another ham-handed edit creating a slew of double-redirects without even discussing the matter, with me or the other two I've finally involved in editing the pages. WHERE'S THE RESPECT FOR OUR TIME, or the way he impacted our time DISCUSSED IN YOUR Wikiquette discussion OR AN/I? Where's the two times his edit crashed my browser, as the section edit on the page no longer matched the system software page... resulting in a lost hour and a half, for the edit got lost sans the system's ability to reestablish page context. So excuse me for feeling provoked by his incompetence. Not one's ever paid me a penny for giving time here. In sum, that whole group of people, yourself included have the problem backwardslike a cart being pushed by a mule. You all wring hands and make tut-tutting noises about one well deserved dressing down that was a one on one communication, totally oblivious to the fact your jumping of the gun is part of the institutional insanity here that makes it increasingly a less and less satisfying place to contribute, and outright hostile most of the damn time.

 If you feel that we need to remove the 750m-figures of him and put only between 350-500 million records. then please, FIND THAT SOURCES by yourself. Do not ask Harout, me, or any other editors to do that for you. 

 Especially to Harout, we need to put our respect to him even sometimes we could not receive his argument.

You are the one who was aggressively pushing TGMP as a WP:RS and becoming hostile and insulting when challenged on it.  You also continue to accuse me of POV pushing and censorship when there is absolutely no evidence to support those claims whatsoever.  The ONLY edits I've made to this article in months were to remove material that was so poorly sourced it may as well have been unsourced, add that ``protector`` was one of men's primary traditional sex roles and qualify the opinions of pro-feminist sources as being pro-feminist sources.  Contrary to the assumptions you have made about me, I do want an NPOV article and care about the quality of WP, both in terms of this article, and in general.    :I see sections all over this article that begin with ``Men's rights activists believe/claim/assert...`` but then the contrarian sections written by pro-feminist sources are not qualified whatsoever but, rather, presented as accepted truth with no ideological slant/bias/lens whatsoever.  Doing this is POV in the extreme.  I am for representing all viewpoints accurately and fairly.. even the ones I fundamentally disagree with!  In order to do so we must first appreciate, and be willing to acknowledge, that there is a fundamental dichotomy here between MRA's and feminists.  Once we've done so we can accurately provide a contextualized point and counter-point presentation.  As long as we pretend that this is not the case and that ``feminism is just about equality`` we will just keep running endlessly on a hamster wheel and wasting each others time.  :If I seem defensive, it's because I am.  I know the history of this article, many of the editors who created the present probation problem and have been having all of my, very reasonable, edits reverted.  The problem with this article, like so many of WP's gender related articles, is that there's a feminist task force that goes around practicing a very formalistic interpretation of WP policies and proceedures when dealing with editors they ideologically disagree with, while coddling editors who, no disrespect intended since I appreciate you are a new editor, like you, make poorly sourced edits as long as those edits confirm their pre-existing biases.    :All that said, I look forward to working with you on improving this article.  18:09, 3`"

The same applies to the almost 50-year-old photograph (by the way, in the former Yugoslavia copyright laws were 50 years, not 100, if it has not been changed recently; the one, not in the article, but at the Wikipedia upload and below this one [with the mother] is more than 50 years old ). In any case, even with that photograph, the circumstance and reasons were trivial; therefore not only that the original authorship cannot be established, it is also legally nonexistent. The third and the fourth photographs were taken by cousins, without any intent of establishing copyrights or authorships, and like in the first two cases almost accidentally (the third photograph taken in the park just because the camera was accidentally there and there was no special intent of taking that photograph or establishing authorship). The fourth one was under similar circumstance and without any desire to establish an authorship or copyright. Note: The circumstances under which these photographs were taken and the reasons of the people who took them (although in the case of the first two there is no way to ever find out who took them) are, we can say—trivial, and exclude any possibility of infringement.  Photographs are simply ineligible. This is the general explanation and maybe you can sort it out in a better way.

0,"""::::::""""Forthcoming book

A trio of LDS scholars have been funded by the LDS church to write a book, Tragedy at Mountain Meadows, to be published by the Oxford University Press:

Ronald W. Walker (BYU Professor of History), 
Richard E. Turley Jr. (managing director of the Family and Church History Department of the Church), and Glen M. Leonard (director of the Church's Museum of Church History and Art). 

The three were granted access to documents in the LDS Church archives. According to Turley, a file in the archives confirms that Lee was acting on his own. The file included the notes of a Mormon historian who, at the request of Church leaders, conducted a confidential investigation of the massacre in 1892. Turley said, """"There are very candid statements on the part of participants to a Church official under the agreement of confidentiality.""""

While the trio found additional evidence of church leaders' culpability, Turley stated that """"Utahns elsewhere in the territory acted to preserve the lives of other troublesome immigrants . . . Unfortunately, the militia and church leaders of Iron County made different decisions, and their acts demand the strongest condemnation . . . Circumstance may explain their acts; nothing can justify them.""""

The new sources the co-authors are using will be made public once their book is published. Turley said although the church is cooperating and is funding the research, the work is """"not a Church commission""""; """"The idea to do the book was ours, not theirs."""" Publication apparently has been delayed as the co-authors have tried to be as thorough in their research as possible. According to Turley, LDS leaders share the authors' desire to bring all available evidence out in the open. First drafts of the book will be circulated for comment among LDS and non-LDS parties, including historians and descendants of the perpetrators and victims. """"Open, candid evaluation of that tragedy can produce catharsis, a cleansing spiritual renewal and healing,"""" Turley said, adding that the authors will """"present the evidence as we find it - honestly, openly and candidly.""""

The above is hardly an example of a brief description, and is far greater than the longest has ever been for the Franz books. I have put back a smaller concise, neutral description that should keep all happy. Posted Central 10 July 2005

 Auto guides and the motoring press are not good sources for an encyclopedia article about """"luxury vehicle"""". This is because automakers feed the press a lot of BS (Boastful Superlatives) who then work hard to write articles adding even more BS to describe their products. The press earns credits from the hands that feed them. Add to this the fact that potential and actual purchasers of luxury vehicles have an insatiable  appetite  for this type of BS. Classifying a particular vehicle as """"luxury"""" is also designed to easily make it superior to other vehicles even if the differences are superficial. Using self-serving BS in marketing claims is a very, very old invention that helps sell products, as well as fuel the fan base with """"bragging"""" rights to which vehicles are """"luxury"""". On the other hand, it is more difficult for most marketers to be humble and genuine. That is why an encyclopedia article has to avoid falling into the trap of using traditional marketing superlatives and hyperbole. —   """

 Near the beginning of the article we find the phrase """"the period of measured time beginning with the year 1, the traditional birthyear of Jesus"""". However, as discussed in Anno Domini#History of Anno Domini, the person who first proposed the Anno Domini epoch, Dionysius Exiguus, left the birth year of Jesus unclear: 
 *He may have considered the Incarnation to be the conception of Jesus, also known as the Annunciation. 
 *He may have considered the Incarnation to be the Nativity of Jesus. 
 *He may have intended the Incarnation to occur in what today we would label 2 BC, 1 BC, or 1 AD. (The year 2 BC is a possibility because one of the year start-dates Dionysius used was the beginning of Emperor Diocletian's reign, 29 August.) 

 This article is not the place for an extended discussion of when the nominal Incarnation occured in the AD system, but the article should not contain a statement that many scholars do not agree with. Can anyone come up with a concise rewrite that reflects the uncertainty about the exact date of the AD epoch?"""

asssiveego has posted his RfA and I have blocked him for it

Hello. I have blocked Masssiveego for his antics on Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Masssiveego which seems like a clear attempt to draw fire from people bitter with his own antics on RfA, with a minimalist nomination and tongue-in-cheek answers to the questions. He seems to have induced a bite from Pschemp at least. This lasts for a week. I previously did this for Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/The Mad Bomber for trolling his own RfA. Please review and feel free to protest on my talk page. Blnguyen | BLabberiNg 

Sounds about right. Cyde Weys 

    Good call  Samir धर्म 

        I don't see any issues with this block. Pure WP:POINT. Can we close the RfA? (Or does it need to be a 'crat?) alphaChimp laudare 

I was thinking of blocking him myself, so obviously I endorse the block. It's rather obvious that he's trolling for attention with all this RfA stuff... let's just not feed him and move on. W.marsh 

RFA has been closed. Support block. – Chacor 

                Hey should I close it then? It's already WP:SNOWballing with opposes and he is blocked after all. - Glen  - shit - 4 edit conflicts later its been done S

                    Sheesh, if you use the shortcut at least shorten the verb to WP:SNOWing. I want snow! P – Chacor 

                        I added an extra day to the block for [33] and [34]. CanadianCaesar Et tu, Brute? 

[edit]

Exhausting community patience?

Once again, it's time to bring this up. He's coming close to exhausting the community's patience, in my view. Thoughts? – Chacor 

    Not yet. I would not have blocked him at all for starting the RfA. In fact i think SNOWing this RfA was a bad idea. Rather I would have let it run the full 7 days. Having 100+ opposes might have finally gotten through to this editor that he needs to reconsider his approach. But with the RfA snowed, he's got ammo to say we aren't treating him right, etc. ++Lar: t/c 

        Perhaps, but there just isn't a reason to let trolls stay. – Chacor 

            Is this user a flat out troll? Sure, close the book right away... Or, is he rescuable? if rescuable is it worth the effort? that's how I evaluate the question of whether community patience is exhausted. I don't think ME is a flat out troll. His contributions are light so not a LOT of effort is justified but I'm not convinced he is not rescuable. Contrast with Tobias, next thread. CLEARLY not a troll, has a big contribution record, therefore worth a fair bit of effort, but I'm starting to think... not rescuable. Make sense? ++Lar: t/c 

Would we simply be gratifying him by letting the RfA run? Blnguyen | BLabberiNg 

    Hard to say. I'm not too sussed either way but I did want to throw out that on balance, gratified or not, this is one time that SNOW isn't the right thing to do. In my view anyway. ++Lar: t/c 

        I think closing it was the right thing to do to avoid disruption. Blocking him... I don't know whether he's a good faith user or not, and I suspect probably not, but I'm generally upset by the level of blocking going on in Wikipedia at the moment. The Land 

    * I think the Masssiveego's RFA voting is a problem and unhelpful, but I think imposing blocks for it is a rather drastic measure. A much better """"penalty"""" would be for the RFA closing bureaucrats to systematically disregard his votes. Regarding the RFA, I agree with Lar that I would not have blocked him for that either, and that a hundred """"oppose""""s on what is in effect an editor peer review might convey the message far more clearly than a block ever will. Sjakkalle (Check!) 
    * I agree with Lar and Sjakkalle. Haukur 
    * Users are allowed to use whatever criteria they like in RfAs. His are high and somewhat arbitrary, but that's his perogative. He feels that there are problems with some admins and thus that the process should be more strict/changed. He has a right to that opinion and should not be persecuted for it. Obviously his RFA self-nom wasn't meant to be a serious attempt, but I also don't see where it caused any significant disruption justifying a block. CBD

I started reading the article thinking that it would be a clear keep, but had to abandon that idea as I read though it. There are no inline citations, so it's hard to tell which of the facts asserted are sourced where, but of the three links provided, one is just an entry in a list, one is a dead link which doesn't show up in the internet archive, and the remaining link is to 247-word news report which offers far fewer facts than are in the article, supporting the suggestion that the article contains a lot of original research. Even if the missing article was was substantial, she still falls far short of WP:BIO. It would be great to include a properly-sourced single paragraph on Mueller in a list of extremely long-lived American people, but without massive new evidence of notability this standalone article looks like a clear delete. If the article was plausibly referenced I'd suggest a merger to a list, but I don't see anything here worth keeping unless new sources are available. BrownHairedGirl (talk) • (contribs) `"

I do have more inquiries. How many administrators are at Wikipedia? Are you one? If I have authored a modern definition on an engineering discipline, can I mention my name?  I want to make sure that what I do and say is verified or challenged not just deleted by someone that  doesn't like my definition. I am a member of the Recording Academy with 23 years of audio engineering experience and it took me many years to develop these theories .  {{helpme}} Orthologist, someone keeps deleting the page. I can't find it anymore click and see (Pre-Mastered Compact Disc)    Thanks for the info. How can I find out who is deleting the page? You know if you read, that it's not Spam. You didn't delete it, right?     Orthologist, thanks for your time and information.     Hello Orthologist, It's been a few days and lots of things happened already. I am still a newbie, but I have made some contributions and deletions too. I've fought off spammers (Who wanted to accuse me of that as well) and got involve on a Wiki Project.  Anyway, I have a question. I volunteered to do a write on real time analyzers, it turns out there is a page on spectrum analyzers (the same thing) but, I don't see it as a good reference for audio mastering. Do I call an administrator and propose disambiguation status for that page? What should I do? Your input is always well received and appreciated.

Thanks for reverting the vandalism on the logarithm page. Unfortunately, you also wiped out part of the article (a graphic image) in the process. I'll put the picture back into the article, but in the future would you please use the ``undo`` button to revert vandalism? Thanks!     It's me again. Thanks for writing back. And apologies are completely unnecessary ... I understand that you were helping out when you took that great big bunch of garbage out of logarithm.I hope it didn't sound like I was complaining the first time – I just want to help you learn something.  Here's how to find the ``undo`` button, On the article's ``History`` page, mark the two versions you want to compare, then hit the ``Compare selected versions`` button (it's a big gray button near the top of the page). That will bring up a ``diff`` page, with the differences between the two versions highlighted. There will be two blue links (edit) and (undo) at the top right of the page, in the ``Current revision`` section. Just left-click on (undo) and you should get the edited page, with the vandalism removed, and with an edit comment already filled in for you!  ``Undo`` should always work when going backwards just one version. It will usually work for multiple steps backward all at once – if it can't figure out how to undo the changes you've selected, it will give you a warning message. Hey – nothing's perfect. Have fun with it!  ;^>     :See Help:Reverting for reverting vandalism in general.    ==Talk:Ghost#Vandalism== Hey, someone pointed out to me that my response to your comment an vandalism on the Ghost talk page might come across as being a bit sarcastic. I want to know if you've taken it that way. If so, I apologize; I've not gotten a lot of sleep in the past couple of weeks. I want you to know that I mean sincerely what I said there.

My editing was undone and all those separate pages were blanked and the information was moved back to the main page.

All contributions are appreciated, but I don't believe it satisfies Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion, and I've explained why in the deletion notice (see also ``What Wikipedia is not`` and Wikipedia's deletion policy).

0,"`  I'm not supporting somebody who is damaging the article. In my view, both of you are attempting to push a POV in the article. The fact that you are inserting sourced POV doesn't stop it being POV. My warning to you was on the basis that you are attempting to send another editor away from the article.  Montanabw is allowed to edit text that you introduced, and isn't required to keep his/her text distinct from yours.  Whilst you may well have included the veterinarian's credentials, did you mention that she is connected with an animal rights group. If not, you are being selective to further a particular POV.  Mayalld (talk)   Retrieved from ``http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:HatAct``  Facts, observations  not POV. Facts and observations from professionals qualified to speak on the subject - Animal Abuse in Rodeo. Yes, I referenced the veterinarian's statements, directing the reader to the animal welfare site. Her professional observations are posted at an animal welfare site. Her observations were sourced. I don't know if she is a ``spokesman`` for the organization, I don't know if she is ``connected`` with an animal rights group. Maybe she is maybe she isn't. Maybe she's the president, maybe she's just a contributer. How far do I have to research a veterinarian's background before including her observations on Animal Abuse in Rodeo in an item about Animal Abuse in Rodeo?  I'm not sending anyone away. Where did I say ``Get out of here``? Mbw is not contributing in a positive way and needs to source her contributions. In one instance, he/she made sweeping statement with a footnote. The footnote supported absolutely nothing in the statement. Is Wiki a collection of misleading info? While I agree that Mbw is allowed to edit my text, he/she is not improving it. And why is everyone having a problem if I edit his/hers? He/she is tweaking mine to subtlely reflect her pro rodeo POV (``animals are practically never injured, abused, bruised, broken, maimed, or killed in rodeo``) or to invite the reader to dismiss mine as the contributions of an ``animal nut``.   `"

According to President Ahmadinejad in 2008 of April 6, do not touch this print ever on the 'Personal and Family Life,' he has one wife, and 7 children, I would know better what Grand Ayatollah Khamenei has, does, concedes over, of how many children he may have, and what they do, and on the austere life style of his within his children's backgrounds, than any other intelligence officer or anthropologist, and historian.  Be advised this one daughter of Grand Ayatollah Khamenei, has shortly, within the time span started to over throw the Persian Nation same as Khomeini in 1979 but in a different manner of political opposition, with support backing by the Iranian Ministries of Intelligence Divisions, Parliament and International UN Member States, as it has been slowly, with names of Military Divisions changes, Regulations, Laws, placement and displacement of Diplomatic Iranian Personnel into Iranian Government Offices, concluded official the name Persia officially in public on Iranian Intelligence Docket Systems, so forth since of 2006 presently in the process, as supported with backing by U.S. Officials, and President Bush. [CNN News witness credibility, do not touch this page, one would be misinforming on his personal austere life style, with family brackground, Democratic Freedom will prevail in Iran.] As stated by me Lika aka Alla, I would know better of who my father is, has done, so forth of how many children he has bared with his wife aka mother, notation or on his family life.

The only Muslim Book of Religion of following as allowed to be preached in Persia is the Koran, not any other man made Religious Value. All other State Regulations, Government Rules, so forth have been changing within the enactment of a French Constitution, similar to the U.S. Constitution as enforcement on Civilians and Government Entities, similar to UK of Britain laws have been enacted in 2007 - presently. All good things take time; do not expect me to endanger the lives by a real war precedent on Persia, as it is now legally being used as a Political reference to Iran. I stated if can I will, and doing so, so I have as Khomeini, now they are slowly proceeding into a new era in time by a Democratic Value of Liberalization in Persia/Iran. President Ahmadinejad has been a close family friend to the Grand Ayatolla Khamenei Family and to Persia/Iran with all clearness of presenting factors of control Liberalization and Democracy on Major Issues, and issues that have been revolving around the Khamenei Family, while residing as President of Iran, where personally enforcing his stay as President of Iran for another term in office; changing the rule of one life time as President by election, or any other State/Governmental Order in Iran. Personally stated Ahmadinejad stays as President [2007 October] till I further say otherwise, I do not know what the Iranian Parliament is going to do further. One of Khamenei’s sons has been delegating the Religious Values of the Koran, as clearly presented ``going to be just ruling on the Religious Values, you run the State, Governmental Laws.`` As has been overall on the States National Laws and Rules within Regulations Guiding Citizens Lives, since of 2007 till present. Did not even allow Larijiani to quit in 2007, forced him to take another seat in office.  There are two different spellings of the name Khamenei, it is spelled on an American Grammar Khameini, ‘Khamenei’ spelling is to not confuse the public between Khomeini, where there are similarities of the name, but two different bodies of governance of Iran since of over throwing in 1979.

Before the change, there was Armour with its listings for melee, mage, and range, followed by Weaponry with its lisings for melee, mage, and range, which is a total of six subheadings.  Now the article has Melee with its listings for armour and weaponry, then Mage with its listings for armour and weaponry, and then Range with its listings for armour and weaponry, which is still a total of six.  We have gone from two main headings to three main headings.  The direction we want to go needs to be decided.  Do we want to talk about armour and weaponry as topics and then break them down between the various classes?  Do we want to talk first about the class (styles) of combat and then break them down between armour and weapons?  My thought was, obviously, the first choice, while QuagmireDog seems to think it should be the second.  I do not think that either is more correct than the other.  They are just different ways of thinking about it or looking at it.  Which will give our readers more useful information without delving into that pit of fancruft our critics are lightning-fast to jump on?  Remember that we still need to bring the rest of the general combat information into this at some point - things like the combat triangle, player versus player combat, etc.     "

0,"""My decision to pursue graduate study in the United States is underscored by my desire to be a part of the graduate program at your institution. Purdue University offers the flexibility needed for such a vast and rapidly changing field. The research facilities and the faculty at the university are par excellent. 

Communications is an industry that has changed our lives. In a very short period it has changed the way we have looked at things since centuries. It is one industry that is going to shape our future for centuries to come. Hence my desire to do masters in electrical engineering with communications as my major. 

My interest in electronics blossomed during my high school years. It was the time when technology had begun to make an impact on the lives of people in India. Hence engineering with electronics as my major was the first choice for my undergraduate studies. Right since the beginning of my undergraduate study electronics is a subject that has fascinated me with its power of applications. The subjects that I have studied include Linear Electronics, Digital Electronics. These laid the foundation for my courses in Electronic Communication & Communication Systems at a later stage. My undergraduate studies already focus on the communications aspect of electronics. A masters degree in electrical engineering with communications as major field is the next logical step. 

For the past four months I have been working as a project trainee at the Indian Institute for Advanced Electronics. I am working on the design and development of a """"PC Controlled Digital Serial Data Generator"""". This short stint has given me invaluable practical experience. It has given me the confidence to pursue a masters degree and also kindled a desire to do research. 

During the course of my work at IIAE, I have come across several scientists. Most of them work in different areas of communications. Interactions with them have made me realize the vastness and the scope of communications. My discussions with them convinced me that specializing in communications will suit me very well. 

The subject of research which interests me very much is spread spectrum communication systems. Coding theory and combinations is another research subject which arouses my curiosity. The subject Communication Theory which I am studying at present introduces these topics in theory. I am eager to find out more about the applications of coding theory to spread spectrum communication systems. 

In addition I have been a student member of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.) for the past three years. Through its workshops/seminars and publications like the 'The Spectrum' it has exposed me to a lot of emerging technologies in the field of communications. 

It is a strong belief in my family that the American education system has the best to offer in the whole world. This belief arises out of the experience that my parents had when they did their Masters of Science in the University of Pennsylvania during the years 1967-69. If I can get an opportunity to be a part of that intellectually stimulating environment, I am sure my talents will be put to optimal use. 

India is a developing country with an enormous potential in the information technology business. To serve the needs of this developing industry and more important its vast population, communications is going to become of utmost importance. Thus conditions here are very conducive to supplement my aspirations when I return after completing my graduate studies."""

0,"`  @AynHaylo The Aramean movement is based on our real heritage and history, which forms this strong foundation! Your invented ``Assyrian`` ethnic identity has no foundation among the Syriac Christians (Suryoye) before the 19th century. Once again, the Syriac-Orthodox Church has clearly its roots in the Aramean nation and can prove an Aramean ethnic identity by its chronicles, which goes hundreds of years back even before the 20th century, whereas the ``Assyrian`` Church of the East can't prove its Assyrian identity before the 19th century. BTW we are actually known as Süryaniler in Turkish and as Syrianin in Arabic, both words mean Syrians, but refer to the Aramaic-speaking Christians. In Arabic you have two words for Syrian, but with different meanings. Moreover, the bible clearly distinguish between Syrians (Arameans) and Assyrians. Syrian is the Greek word for Aramean and this word was adopted by the Arameans in their mother tongue and they have called themselves Suryoye since then. I don't care about what other people call us. Most Germans call oriental-looking persons Turks and every black person is just an African. What matters is what we call ourselves. We have always called ourselves Suryoye (Syrians) and our origin is Aramaic, not pseudo Assyrian.   ``The people we Greek call Syrians, they CALL THEMSELVES Arameans`` (Posidonius)  `"

0,"`  :I agree with  the secitions Culture and Economy need a thorough rewrite. Especially the former: there, we have to change the whole concept. Just naming allegedly ``famous`` or ``notable`` Slovenians in culture is NOT what this section should be about: we should introduce new subsections (besides Cusine, which also needs heavy editing) - Literature, Performing Arts, Visual Arts, Architecture, Media, Customs and Traditions (wich could also be included in a larger sub-section, named simply Society). Sport should go under Culture, as well (and we should balance the images there: two images on winter sports is too much). :Also, the section Politics should be about the political system (which also includes the party system, of course) and political culture, not on recent political events (except for the really important ones - a change of government or a vote of no-confidence doesn't qualify in this category in my view). I also think the section should be renamed to Government, and Political System should be the first sub-section. In English, Politics has a narrower meaning than in Slovene. :The Demographics sections lookw OK to me, the Economy one needs editing (the Tourism subsection can stay as it is, while the Trasnport one needs to be heavily edited and trimmed; we should have a short sub-section on Agriculture).   `"

 == Economizer's new edits == 

 quoting yoru new section “This contrasts with the subjective theory of value as an explanation for differing prices of goods, which says that value is determined by a good's ability to satisfy a want and its scarcity.” Ricardo himself discusses this verry topic (scarcity and desire in shaping exchange-value) in the his “Principles”. So again you're erecting a strawman artilce so that you can contrast it with your original research (which is only original in that it plagarizes Ricardo and then uses him as the strawman against which your article is contrasted).   
 :I noted that Ricardo found exceptions to his labor theory of value. But, he did not abandon it in favor of the subjective theory. The labor theory clearly cannot explain exchange value, the adherents to the labor theory tried for a long time. By the way, now you're getting nasty again, by claiming I'm plagiarizing Ricardo.   

 :: We're not talking about exceptions to his labor theory of value. We're talking about his theory of exchange-value where he always sees exchange-value influenced by value along with scarcity and desire for a commodity. He doesn't use the term LTV nor does he use the term subjectivist, because those terms are contemporary terms. But the contrast you make is completely contrived. You provide no supporting evidence from Ricardo that supports anything you say about his theory of exchange-value. BTW, are you saying that for the subjectivist theory, production conditions do not effect exchange-value. Because then I could see the contrast. But you should probably just contrast it with contemporary neoclassical economic theory that more people are familiar with, because neoclassical theory (like Ricardo) holds that both production conditions and scracity effect exchange-value. And you've gotten nasty by claiming an article that carfeully cites sources is original research while working on an article that cites no sources whatsoever (the subjectivist theory of value)   

 :::Saying that I think you're engaging in """"original research"""" is not accusing you of doing anything malicious or dishonest. It just means that I think you're drawing your own conclusions from things instead of referencing sources that draw those conclusions. I could be right or I could be wrong. Your statements may be referenceble or they may not be. If they're not referenceable than they shouldn't be here. I don't doubt that you're doing your honest best to try to interpret correctly. Don't accuse me of """"plagiarizing."""" Plagiarizing means taking someone's words and claiming them as my own. If you think the subjective theory of value article is original research, then by all means put some tags up so we can verify things. This is how Wikipedia articles are improved. Please work with the process. Above all, don't think that the article will ever be stable even if a consensus is reached, because new people are always coming in and a new consensus has to be reached. If you worked on the ariticle before and got it the way you wanted it, great. But everything in this article will be erased and redone in another way over and over and over. It's very sysiphian. I look it more as a learning experience than anything else. If all my work is destroyed in time, and it will just as yours will, I really don't care.   

 :::: It's not my work per se that I'm trying to proect. I understand how wikipedia works. However, this article and many artciles related to this are subject to very hoaky edits like the ones you've been trying to make. People want the LTV to be a certain strawman theory so that they can knowck it down. They  have countless obsscure authors no one haw ever heard of to cite. Or they cite reputable suthors but construe them in ways that are entirely unsupportable (your quotation of the very first heading in Ricardo's ‘Principles’ comes to mind). Besides that heading, there's very little in the chapter that supports the ridiculous strawman position you accuse Ricardo of. The whole thing degrades the Wiki experience (for editors/contributors and readers alike). So I don't care much that my work is sacred or that my prose should not be touched. But this is an article I care to see held to decent academic standards. Whereas many people (who think the LTV is anacrhonistic) want to the article to serve some auxillary purpose. 

 :::: So I welcome honest contributions from those who've read primary and secondary sources on the LTV. And I welcome contributions to the criticism section from those critical of the theory (those I'm less familiar with). But I don't support the view that the critics should be the one defining the theory to make their jobb of criticism easi"

The new cybernetics is a study of self-organizing systems, which looks beyond the issues of the ``first cybernetics`` - the politics and sciences of control - to the autonomy and self-organization capabilities of complex systems.   Unlike its predecessor, the new cybernetics concerns itself with the interaction of autonomous political actors and subgroups and the practical can reflexive consciousness of the subject who produce and reproduce the structure of political community. A dominant consideration is that of recursiveness, or self-reference of political action both with regards to the expression of political conciousness and with the ways in which systems build upon themselves.   * Tom Darby (1982), The Feast: Meditations on Politics and Time on p. 220 states:  ... the so-called ``new cybernetics`` ... attempts to move away from the cybernetics of Wiener. Whereas the old cybernetics is still tied to the image of the machine (i.e., physics), the new adheres to the image of organism (biology). The main task of the new cybernetics is to overcome entropy through using ``noise`` as positive feedback.  * Gertrudis van de Vijver (1994), New Perspectives on Cybernetics: Self-Organization, Autonomy and Connectionism on p.97:  With Pask, we agree that the old cybernetics, the new cybernetics and, we like to add, the (old and new) cognitive paradigms are not that revolutionary different from each other. And as is mostly the case, the so-called new paradigms are in a sense ``older`` that the ``old`` paradigms. The so-called ``old`` paradigms were in most cases strategically succesful specializations in a general framework. Their sucess was based on a strong but useful simplification of the issues. The ``new`` paradigms are further specializations in the earlier one, or (as is mostly the case) a strategic retreat which boradens the specialized approach and is a return to the orginal, broader inspiration and outlook. This is what happens, we believe, with the new cybernetics, the post-cybernetics, as well as with the new cognitive approach...  Now if I would make an article with just these three sources it would look like this:   New cybernetics is a study of self-organizing systems. It looks beyond the issues of the ``first``, ``old`` of ``original`` cybernetics and their politics and sciences of control, to the autonomy and self-organization capabilities of complex systems.

The premiership came down to the last match between West Perth and Rovers (not really a grand final, as it was still part of the regular fixtures), which resulted in a draw, 4.10 (WP) to 4.7 (R) – I'm guessing behinds weren't counted at this stage. Also, I think this comment pretty much confirms it: """"Fremantle supporters will feel very sore at not having any interest in the final match for the premiership. Really they have themselves to blame for the school-boyish behavior they have shown in ignoring the Association."""" Fremantle later challenged Rovers to a premiership decider under any umpire selected except Mr. Croft, which Rovers quite rightfully declined to take part in.

 I am curious, the CIA fact book states that the USA is 81.7% white 12.9% black, 4.2% Asian, and 2% others? This adds up to about 100%, what happened to all the Mexicans, and Hispanics? Are they saying that ones a Mexican crosses over the border he or she becomes white? that makes no sense. At what percentage does a mestizo become white, 50%, 75%, or 90%. According to the U.S census if a Mexican marks Mexican on the U.S Census, he or she will be classified as white. This leads to my final question, shouldn’t then most Mexicans be classified white, according to the CIA? Finally, I have been to several parts in Mexico and I have noticed that many, or the majority of Mexicans in central Mexico look whiter than Italians, French and middle eastern, which are classified as white everywhere. A large percentage of the Argentinean population has Amerindian mixture, doesn't that make them Mestizo's? Any ways, we will never know for sure until a large genetic sample is taken. I agree with having a predominate 35-45%, if you look at the Aregentina demographics it states that 57% of the population has ameridian ancestory, but 85-97% of the population states that they are white?

0,"`  == Supposed influence on historical events ==  I am entirely new to editing so I hope someone can guide me on this matter. The claim ``The meetings would have a great influence on the shaping of the modern country of Canada as well as on the Pacific Northwest of the United States`` appears in the beginning with a now invalid citation link, which isn't terribly surprising given it was listed in 2006. The issue is the cited material does not back the quoted claim in any fashion and nor does any historical narrative I have read. The diplomatic wrangling between the Americans and British for a few decades was over the Columbia River as a border (or not). Eventually the British agreed to an American proposal for the continuation of the border along 49th the parallel.  Where does the PGO fit into this? It stated the 54'40 was the northern border despite having no control over any land north of the Columbia River. In 1845 an agreement with the local Hudson's Bay Company was established, with the company ``joining`` the government. Theoretical control was extended by the PGO, but the majority of the offices for the northern districts were held by the British. I don't see this event holding ``great influence`` over both Canada and the United States. About the only matter that the PGO was to create that influenced (only America) was the Cayuse War.  So what should be done about this exactly? The claim is simply far too bold to be considered historically accurate. In the meantime I updated the link, but it is worth repeating it doesn't validate the claim.   `"

 :The US is clearly a representative democracy, ability to change the constitution has nothing to do with it.  On top of that, as you point out, it is possible for the US government to amend its constitution (""""amend"""" meaning, in effect, """"change"""").  It's just that it requires a super majority of 66% in both houses of Congress, and then it has to be ratified by 3/4 of the state governments, so it is pretty rare for an amendment to be successful.

0,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Yes, I am aware that there is no reference in the Australian Census about Latinos but this is trivial, there does not need to be any reference. You seemed to be confused on who actually is Latino and this seems to be your main point of debate. Going by your logic the pages Anglo-Celtic Australian and Black Australian should be drawn into question as they are also not referenced in the Australian Census. The rest of the page shouldn't need citations and references as no more information than what is available in the census is really given. And how exactly am I wrong? ``I'm not saying that your entirely wrong`` Again this opinion seems to me, to have come from your belief that I am not aware of what or who a Latino is, and in my opinion, no offense intended, is due to yourself not grasping the concept of a Latino. My view is further strengethed by your comment: ``I think it's dubious to list people because they're of Latin American descent all down as 'Latino Australian' when they are in fact of different ancestral, ethnic and national backgrounds.``NEWLINE_TOKENThis is exactly what Latinos are, of different ancestral, ethnic and national backgrounds.
