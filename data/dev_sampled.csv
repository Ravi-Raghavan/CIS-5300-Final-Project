Your version http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Energy_%28disambiguation%29&oldid;=215040252 runs counter to the manual of style in several ways. First, wp is not a dictionary which means the lead line cannot read like this Energy (from Greek ἐνέργεια ``operation, activity``) may refer to. Second, the primary article is the root article (the article named as the dab page but without ``disambiguation``) ... so Energy is the primary article. Of course there may be legitimate disagreement with this but it can only be addressed by changing the name of that article to Energy (qualifier) not by refusing to follow guidelines on this dab page. Third, each entry should start with the target article. Fourth, ``toponymy`` is incorrectly formatted. Fifth, ``as a proper name`` is incorrectly formatted and has no entries.

Here is a link to their new show: . That is the best wrestling going today. TNA lost all sense of direction. I hope they get back to their old ways, but now they seem like Raw. A crap load of promos and about 20 minutes of wrestling. Though last week's episode was very good. TNA are trying to raise the bar with Samoa Joe's new gimmick in which he gets himself DQed then beat the living hell out of the guy. Last week he hung a guy upside down by his feet and beat him like a pinata with a kendo stick. It was funny and great. Most hate it, since it is controversial, but I loved it. They need to raise the bar. Check it out if you want. They have a few good things going now but at the moment WWE are doing better. Hopefully after the storyline involving The Main Event Mafia and The Front Line in over, they'll go back to their old ways. Sting is supposed to retire this year. Angle might head back to WWE. If that is the case, then we'll get new blood in the main event.

 Binky, grow up. All you want is to be obstructive and destructive of real info included on WP - you're solidly outed. You might as well admit it. At least to yourself. Over here you write: """"You know, I like your Strauss-Kahn addition, using good sourcing, but this bit about bootlegs is your weak area. You need to find a source that says that Fogerty's music can be found on bootlegs"""": that being so, why don't you do it yourself, and thus help additions those less skillful at manipulating WP than you, try to contribute? Instead of actively deleting and obstructing the info being included, under increasingly fanciful pretexts (incidentally, """"source that says that Fogerty's music can be found on bootlegs"""" is easily found on Youtube and elsewhere, e.g. http://www.freetimeweb.nl/home/muziek/ccr/johnfogerty_bootleg.html (I'm sure even you can google """"Fogerty bootleg"""", though actually I didn't add that info - I only supplied the ref, before you deleted it all). But you deleted it or had it deleted, instead of supporting it with adjustments, as you could've done, improving instead of obstructing - how's that for an idea?). You appear to be an amateur psychopat, taking out your failed real life on innocents on WP. You a-soul. Be a good person. Instead of being destructive and obstructive, be constructive. If you know how - if not, try to learn. Even a miserable psychopat like you can turn around. Try. - Plus, incidentally, I haven't been edit-warring but reverting your edit-warring and vandalism (check history if you suddenly don't recall - but your memory is tendentially selective, I'm sure, recalling only that which supports your lies, right?). I'm no expert at WP and have no time to become one - I only wanted to contribute, not to get embroiled with an apparent psychopat like you. Plus re new IPs: if frequent power-outages happen to change my IP, don't flatter yourself that it's in response to your unacceptable behaviour: you're not on par with hurricane Nina. At all. You're merely a small gust temporarily confusing, but achieving nothing - except making people tire of you. You really are a tiresome fogey, as demonstrated when you write and admit: """"despite the truth of what you were inserting"""". Well, that truth being so, why don't you help fix it, instead of hounding away the contributor? But you apparently don't think facts should have primacy on WP, rather your quarrelling should, right? - I'm no expert on the rules you misuse, and won't waste time to become one - as I have a real life. I merely contribute where I can, as an attitude to life. Try it. You might like it. Actually -). Instead of perfecting being an apparent grumpy old man and failed psychopat, scouring WP for victims. You won, because I'm not interested in your fight. Now you've successfully excluded good info from WP, info which even you concede is """"the truth"""". That's a pyrrhic victory if ever there was one. Hope this little letter changes you for the better, because that's truly needed. Try it: Help info get on to WP, instead of picking quarrels by deleting what even you call """"the truth"""". Focus on getting correct info on to WP, instead of getting lost in """"the system"""". - That's just an idea, but think it over. It might do you good. Get well soon. Bye now.

0,"  == law vs conscience ==  The Law has no authority over anyone because the law is a thing. A thing has no power, no rights and no authority. It can’t speak, hear or feel. The Law was instituted by those that are powerful and wealthy as a form of their own protection. They that formed the Law have also designed loopholes so that they may escape the penalty of that Law. They are the Lawless ones. The knowledge of Good and Evil produces a conscience in us. By having a conscience we all feel guilt.  The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil produced a conscience in us. If you look at the story of Adam and Eve you will notice as soon as they ate off the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil that they became ashamed, worried, confused and guilty. When the Lord said, “If you eat of this tree you shall die,” You will die because of your guilt. Before that event took place we had no conscience much like unreasoning animals, no guilt. Look at the animals, they just exist not knowing good and evil.  Before long humans started forming a legal system from this knowledge. This legal system is still forced on us today. It is known as government or civilizations. We belong to a civilized world. We must reject it. To gain access to the Tree of life we must eliminate the standard that we have created civilization with. The Law. The Law forces us to be guilty. It takes away peace in the world. The knowledge of good and evil and the fruit of it which is the Law, is standing in the way of the Tree of Life. It is an abominable thing. Our conscience must rule over us not the Law."

0,"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== NR post office ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHello - I came across your query on the discussion page for the New Rochelle Post Office. If you want the correct information you cannot rely on what Orlady has told you. She is the sole individual objecting to the use of the term 'mural' when referring to the artwork that is in the building. The building is a NRHP however not so much for the architectural significance, but for the murals inside. Specific reference to the term 'mural' can be seen in a number of sources that were provided.  These sources include very reliable documents including: United States Post Offices in New York  1858 to 1943  Thematic Resources (the National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form), The Westchester County Planning Board discussing the post office in relation to re-developing the site,further discussions,  and the New York Times article about the artist selected to paint the murals. The nomination form is the most irrefutable source validating the information (it specifically references two of the three murals when discussing the importance of post office art). Additionally, the city of New Rochelle continues with redevelopment of the area and has recently come to the decision that the significance of the building itself is minimal, with its only true attribute being the 'distinctive curved contour' of the front facade which is familiar to residents of the area and should be maintained. (Im sorry but I cant find this specific document at the moment). The continuing reverting of this information is entirely the result of Orlady who personally does not seem to care for the facts. Unfortunately it is resulting in a deficient and inaccurate article. I also should mention that blocking users as alleged puppets of a banned user seems to be the most useful means for Orlady to control the content of certain articles. She is clearly abusing the tool. The validity of her claims is questionable at best. I was blocked as a result of my contributions to this article, and was labeled a 'sock'. Considering that I am in no way connected to the banned user, I found it rather disturbing to be blocked based on 'evidence' that has absolutely no validity whatsoever. Perhaps you can spend a moment to review the information provided and the facts will speak for themselves. Thank You"

Much of the relevant information has been removed or confused in the merge or copy/paste or whatever an editor did. The hollow, although lumped in with the World Heritage site is really about a different set of issues including nomadic peoples, archeology sites, enormous variation in terrain, endangered animals etc. The current article on Uvs Nuur seems to have missed all the relevant points on the geological aspects, plus the name of the article is different from the name given on World Heritage Site. Further, the editors have disregarded that almost all citations are about the basin; there is hardly anything in the article about the lake.   If you refuse to allow editors to write articles that they are interested in, and insist on an instant mindless merge, we can have an RFC, which I will abide by, unless you consent to a rewrite of the current article so it is accurate and not confusing. Why do you have such an investment in preventing other editors from writing articles about what they are interested in. It is against policy to #REDIRECT without a discussion which is what was done before. Please consider this, rather than instinctively merge everything.

 Removing unquestionable personal attacks from your own user talk page is much less of a concern than removing comments from other pages in Wikipedia.

 Wikipedia reaches Consensus through discussion and negotiation. If there's rough consensus, we're done. If you have substantive reasons to not move to the other title, can you please repeat them? Note that this particular page move does not require admin intervention at this point in time, so as long as we're patient, we can just agree on what to do and just do it.    Note that if we're impatient we can break stuff and might need an admin, so do take care with that -)  

 Requested Moves gets abused more often than that it gets used correctly. At times when it gets used correctly, I have no issues with it. Today was not a day where it got used correctly. -P Alright, I'm done talking about requested moves now.  

 If you think the page must have another name, please clearly tell me those reasons, and let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Omega point is fringe.`` That claim doesn't even make coherent sense, besides the fact that you replaced a literate entry with an illiterate edit.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENEven if one incorrectly thinks that the Omega Point Theory is ``fringe,`` that has no logical connection with the edit that Jeffro77 made. Jeffro77 replaced this entrywhich is very similar to the version that existed there since October 31, 2008, with some improvementswith this entry, giving the excuse in his edit summary of ``WP:FRINGE,`` which doesn't even make sense as an explanation for his edits: i.e., deletion of a number of citations; deletion of the information on theologian Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg's defense of the theology of the Omega Point Theory; etc. As well, there's no need for the large displayed quote, as the previous entry already stated that Prof. David Deutsch doesn't agree that the Omega Point is God; furthermore, Jeffro77's edit deletes the mention of the fact that Prof. Deutsch endorses the physics of the Omega Point Theory.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn addtion, Jeffro77's edit isn't even literate, as he give the following mangled citation to Prof. Deutsch: ``Chapter 14: ``The Ends of the Universe,`` with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here``. Whereas the version before was properly cited: ``David Deutsch, The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes—and Its Implications (London: Allen Lane The Penguin Press, 1997), ISBN 0713990619. Extracts from Chapter 14: ``The Ends of the Universe,`` with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here and here.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs stated above, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he would delete mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an ``eminent physicist`` in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAdditionally, while Jeffro77's ``fringe`` claim's aren't even relevant to his edit, they have already been refuted numerous times. Indeed, Jeffro77 himself refutes this claim in this very edit of his: to state again, therein Jeffro77 himself called Prof. Deutsch an ``eminent physicist`` in his own words. So obviously Jeffro77 himself must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs well, Prof. Tipler himself has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and his identification of the Omega Point as being God in a peer-reviewed academic journal: see Frank J. Tipler, ``The Omega Point as Eschaton: Answers to Pannenberg's Questions for Scientists,`` Zygon: Journal of Religion & Science, Vol. 24, Issue 2 (June 1989), pp. 217-253. Regarding the physics, Prof. Tipler has published his Omega Point Theory in many peer-reviewed science journals, including a number of the leading physics journals such as Reports on Progress in Physics (one of the world's leading physics journals) and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (one of the world's leading astrophysics journals). The Wikipedia article on the Omega Point Theory lists seven different mainstream peer-reviewed scientific journals in which Tipler's Omega Point Theory has been published (and that's not including the Zygon journal). That is quite a significant amount.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJeffro77 is out of control. Given his mangled and illiterate Deutsch citation, he doesn't even coherently know what he's doing: he's simply wildly deleting information he dislikes, like a bull on a rampage in a china shop.  `"

When I came across them, it went straight to my inner ear and made me disoriented within seconds and physically nauseous within a minute of exposure. The fact that it emits at up to 94 decibels, to me, should make it highly controversial. At 85 dB, OSHA requires hearing protection in a factory. 94 decibels is louder than a lawnmower, and these speakers are usually stuck run above your head on sidewalks. To some of the previous comments in this article, to me, The Mosquito less of an anti-loitering machine and more of a military sound-weapon.

Unlike the US Navy, where warships are issued with sequential hull numbers when they are ordered and retain those numbers throughout their life, in British (and other European) navies there are no hull numbers. The pennant numbers which were issued the ships were issued at random (using any number which happened to be available), and were often subject to variation; pennant numbers were in any case a fairly recent innovation, dating from the start of World War One, prior to which there were no numbers issued to British warships. Many smaller warships changed their number (and certainly the ``flag superior`` part of the pennant number (i.e. the alphabetical letter preceding the actual number), sometimes several times. The convention that has been agreed by Wiki editors for pre-1948 British warships is that the ships name is followed (in brackets) by the year of launch; the year of launch is thus used to distinguish between warships which have had the same name - for example, there have been sixteen British warships bearing the name HMS Phoenix, going back to the 16th century, of which your submarine was the last one; thus the launch date is used to distinguish between them, e.g. ``HMS Phoenix (1929)``, ``HMS Phoenix (1911)``, ``HMS Phoenix (1895)``, ``HMS Phoenix (1879)``, ``HMS Phoenix (1832)``, etc. Regards, Rif.   20:38, 24 November`"

We merely document the established views of the scientific community, wherein we note Orch-OR is an unproven, minority viewpoint and consequentially the subject matter of WP:FRINGE.  As  first argued, there are many hypothetical models for microtubules, including Penrose/Hameroff's ideas, cytoskeletal tensegrity, tubulin healing, microtubule luminal transport, and others equally speculative. Models like these are ``a dime a dozen``. To be mentioned in this article, an independently reviewed secondary or tertiary source must directly connect microtubules to some particular model. (e.g. a review article in Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology, a critically reviewed textbook on cell biology, a mention in Nature's cytoskeletal milestones). There exist no such sources for Orch-OR. Thus, it would be a violation of WP:NPOV to include any discussion of Orch-OR in Microtubule, however minor.   —  `"

One argument for this theory is that a simultaneous phenomenon is happening on the planet Mars, Mars Hints at Solar, not Human, Cause for Warming, Scientists Say, by Kate Ravilious, 2/28/07, National Geographic via nationalgeographic.com.  which suggests that Global Warming may not be limited to the only planet where human interaction could have influence.
In addition, while Venus is the token example of an Earth-like planet globally warmed by excessive C02 in the atmosphere, there is no man-made industrialism or other sources of greenhouse emissions present on Venus.

I find nothing oppinionated about this entry, and it is cited by a reputable source (National Geographic), and it portrays a valid point."

0,"`   ==Concerns over Tom Walker== A full two paragraphs is spent discussing Tom Walker's ``rebutal`` of the relatively common position that work-week restrictions are not effective against unemployment.  I was instantly left wondering, who is Tom Walker.   Tom walker turns out to be a social policy activist   (Yes, I'm pretty sure I have the right Tom Walker).  His rebutal has not to my knowledge been published in a peer reviewed journaland my opinion, as a PhD candidate, is that it is riddled with enough errors of logic as to not even merit consideration as reasonable dissent.  Unfortunately, Mr. Walker is so obscure, I can't find anyone who has taken the time to critique him in a peer reviewed journal eitherwhich isn't surprising given that his paper was never published in an accepted journal.  As much as I'd like to include some real argument against the commonly held position of economists, I don't think this Tom Walker stuff passes muster to merit inclusion.  I intend to delete the paragraphs relating to him.  I invite people to come forward with information suggesting that * Tom Walker is actually a figure of merit, qualified to have so much prominence in this article. * has published his rebutal in a generally accepted peer reviewed journal Also, if people have any replacement suggestions.

Also, why are members of the Church of Jesus Christ Latter Day Saints only 'professedly Christian?'While unfamiliar with their beliefs, they have 'Jesus Christ' in their name, and such a statement seems to be neglecting NPOV.

0,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Comment by ==NEWLINE_TOKEN  It is NOT acceptable at all that Rasgulla or Roshogolla was created at Odisha. The primary ingredient of Rossogolla is Chhana or cottage cheese. The Indians first learnt the art of making chhana from the French/Portuguese who stayed in a colony at Chandannagore in Hoogli District, West Bengal during the British Raj. In fact, this art of curdling milk into Chhana was considered a taboo by the Hindus and no Chhana products were allowed inside temples or offerred for any holy ritual. Consequently, it is not possible that Rossogolla was created in Odisha centuries back when the art of making Chhana was first learnt not before the later half of 18th Century or the first half of 19th Century. Moreover, it cannot be offerred at Puri temple as Chhana was considered taboo as milk which was considered very holy had to be curdled to make Chhana. It is only in 1868 that the Rossogolla was first created in Bagbazar, North Kolkata in West Bengal.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFACT-1 The Hindu female deity Lakshmi is served rasagollas on the last day of the annual Rath Jatra festival at Puri. This is a 600+ year old tradition called NILADRI BIJAY.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFACT-2 The word cheese is derived from Latin Caseus that comes from Sanskrit Kaasi indicating that chhena was made in India in ancient times.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFACT-3 Even in the rest of Bengal, outside Kolkata, it is the larger, browner Oriya version of rasagolla that is prepared. The K. C. Das/Ganguram chewy “sponge” rasagolla is confined only to Kolkata.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFACT-4 The only Portuguese cheese in Kolkata is the Bandel cheese which is very salty and smoked. It is available in New Market, and Anglo-Indians usually buy it. It is totally different from sweet chhena dishes.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFACT-5 Even the Bengali dish Sondesh predates the arrival of the Portuguese.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFACT-6 All true Portuguese origin dishes – Bibenca, Vindaloo (Vin de Alho in portuguese), Kaju (Caju in Portuguese.), Batata (Batata in Portuguese), have Portuguese sounding names. But chhena does not sound like Queijo in Portuguese.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFACT-7 The Portuguese arrived in Baleshwar, Orissa at the same time as Bengal.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFACT-8 Even KT Achaya merely hypothesized Portuguese origin (and was wrong). It took a chauvinist Bengali writer Chitrita Banerjee to stake a formal Bengali claim to the rasagolla. Her book is so narrowly focussed on Bengali readership that she freely uses Bengali terms everywhere, making it difficult for non-Bengalis to even read.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFACT-9 Even if the Portuguese were to have introduced chhena to India (which is wrong), the timeline is enough for the Puri temple cooks to have picked it up and incorporated it into the temple cuisine.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFACT-10 Rasagolla has been cooked in Salepur for one and a half centuries.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFACT-11 Milk curdling from whey was done way back in 12th century India (See P. Arundhati's book,`` The Royal Life in Manasollasa,``, Sundeep Prakashan, 1994.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFACT-12 Rasagolla is made from whey-curdled milk. Even if KT Achaya was correct, the Portuguese would simply have shown Bengalis how to curdle milk from acid. It has no bearing on the history of rasagolla.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFACT-13 The K C Das site also claims that Nobin Das wanted to patent rasgulla. Except that there was no patent law in India those days! The first ever legislation to protect intellectual property law had just been introduced in India! It was Act VI of 1856 on Protection of Inventions. It granted ``exclusive privileges`` to the inventor. The legislation was designed only to safeguard British colonial interests. The first real patent law enacted in India was the Indian Patents and Designs Act 1911. Even this law was to safeguard British colonial interests and not designed to protect Indian inventors. This led to the Indian Patents Act of 1970: the first patent law designed to protect the likes of Indian inventors such as Nobin Das, which was over a century since he masqueraded as the creator of the rasgulla.`"

I mean, these aren't make-up figures.   And so people are going to have to look at the record. Look at the record of the man running for the president.   They don't name him the most liberal in the United States Senate because he hasn't shown up to many meetings. They named him because of his votes. And it's reality.   It's just not credible to say he's going to keep taxes down and balance budgets.

You made reference to the fact that people make their computations on a calculator or computer, which, you correctly point out, does not use the system of real numbers.

When engineers built their various systems of arithmetic, they were not promoting their's as superior, but rather theirs was intended to be used as a close approximation to a mainstream mathematical number system. The floating point and double precision floating point numbers are supposed to be approximately real numbers. The unsigned and signed integers are approximations for the actual integers. etc.   "

It is called Conflict of Interest. This is a Wikipedia policy.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI may quote or add comments from your excellent work to Wikipedia, but, you cannot do it yourself. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYour contribution which is a direct quote from your SSRN publication is also not encyclopedic - as they say over here on Wikipedia.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI also disagree with what you are stating. We can discuss this matter here on this discussion page as it is normally done on Wikipedia. I appreciate that you are new on Wikipedia and that you are a well known and top of the class academic.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHerewith then the contribution from Prof Baskerville that I removed from the article:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*``This the IASB Framework  describes (as above) how capital maintenance is undertaken in two ways:NEWLINE_TOKENFirstly, “A financial concept of capital is adopted by most entities in preparing their financial statements. Under a financial concept of capital, such as invested money or invested purchasing power, capital is synonymous with the net assets or equity of the entity”. NEWLINE_TOKENSo most entities undertake to report that they have maintained their financial capital and do not report physical capital maintenance. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*Secondly, you may find some public sector entities consider that their stewardship responsibilities are best served by also reporting physical capital maintenance e.g. is the capacity of the waterworks, waste water system etc in the local town the same as, or better, than it was last year? Some Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will be chosen to report this. The Framework states:NEWLINE_TOKEN“Under a physical concept of capital, such as operating capability, capital is regarded as the productive capacity of the entity based on, for example, units of output per day”.  These are two ‘concepts of capital’. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*Thirdly, and this is confusing, a legal meaning in the UK arose as follows: English law developed the ‘doctrine of capital maintenance’ with the aim of ensuring that a company cannot return its share capital back to its shareholders as dividends. The ‘doctrine of capital maintenance’ underpins the legal rules addressingNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*-TAB_TOKENpayment of dividends to shareholders;NEWLINE_TOKEN*-TAB_TOKENreduction of a company’s share capital or reserves;NEWLINE_TOKEN*-TAB_TOKENa company’s purchase of its own sharesNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*and other aspects. From October 2008 private companies in the UK will be allowed to reduce their share capital without the need to go to court``.NEWLINE_TOKENSo when a commercial lawyer is discussing capital maintenance they may be referring to this third concept.Baskerville, Rachel F., 100 Questions (and Answers) About IFRS (January 24, 2010).

There are other authors who explicitly says this. They are reputed too. They tick all the boxes of WP:RS. But, they are themselves Yadavs, and others don't have the reputation Rao enjoys. So, I am not sure if i should use those sources. However, you should present something if you think, people have stated anything contrary. In fact, MSA Rao merely compiles what Bhandarkar and others have already established. You should have a look into the deleted Ahirs as Yadav section. This will clear a lot of your doubts. I am interested in bringing back the entire section and not just a statement. This topic exists as a subject and should contain all the arguments by different scholars, going into finer points of this aspect.  `"

0,"  A good basis for the article, but with plenty of scope for expansion. I'm already busy on the George RR Martin and Steven Erikson pages, but I'll try to get around to expanding this and the other PFH pages with the inclusion of infoboxes and so forth. A few notes on the existing information: the Night's Dawn Universe is only the setting for the trilogy and the two companion volumes, the Second Chance at Eden anthology and the Confederation Handbook guidebook. His other seven books and his next three are all set outside of the Night's Dawn Universe. The paperbacks of the novels are only split in multiple volumes outside the UK (the original country of publication); in the UK you can get the three books are one-volume mass-market paperbacks. Some of the information is a bit POV, such as the higher levels of sex and violence than in other SF books. I've certainly read books with far more that NDT. Otherwise, some good information there. "

0,"`  == Ettlinger Being Jewish + His Family ==  Hi all,  I learned about Adrian’s death after a web search yielded this Wikipedia article (see my post of ``In Memoriam`` about him to the Freecell Solving Discussions mailing list), and since he was a good Internet friend of mine, and we corresponded extensively on E-mail, I’d like to help with the English Wikipedia article about him. In any case, Ettlinger told me in a private E-mail that he was Jewish (at least by descent - he wasn’t an observant/religious Jew and said something about being a deist), and so I think his article should be added to the American Jews by occupation category. One problem I see there is that I don't see any sub-category for Jewish American Engineers and/or Jewish American software developers (he was both). I know that Richard Stallman is a Jewish (also only by decent) American software developer, and he belongs to the categories ``American computer programmers`` and ``American Jews`` and there are naturally many others. I have kept most of the E-mails with him, so can upload them in part to my web-site or elsewhere for citation, nut will it be considered a self-reference? So what should be done?  Adrian also told me about his family (two children if I remember correctly, and four or five grandchildren, all but one are attending university now), but I don't think he mentioned any names. Should they be mentioned as well?  I'll try to improve the entry about him in other respects. Thanks to all the Wikipedia editors who wrote what exists up to now based on the research.    `"

Not accepting personal attacks is one such boundry, another is courtesy, and another is mutual respect. If these personal boundries break down, subsequent discussion can degenerate into generalised mudslinging, which I think is what happened with the RFC's I have been the subject of.

As a generalisation, it is generally a good idea to avoid accusations based on generalisations, because I would end up being painted in a bad light whether I particiated or not.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::With regard to the RFC, the lack of courtesy shown by not being notified of a draft being started is indicative of a lack of respect for myself, or at least that is my personal view (valid or not).

Unfortunetly, that did not happen.

And not just South Vietnam used ``Republic`` in its name, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Socialist Republic of Vietnam also use ``Republic`` in their names and call themselves ``Republic.`` It might be confused at first, but later people will distingush and get use to it. I took the idea from List of countries by date of transition to republican system of government. We don't have to mention too much about the 20th century. Like other periods, the 20th century is just a small portion of the whole national history. I want make all periods to be balanced.

I think the 1st paragraph of the section is ok (about how the film's not meant to be realistic), as are the last 3 (self lacing shoes, hoverboards and the Cubs); but I'm beginning to think the discussion of what it did and didn't get right should be removed entirely. Instead replace it with a generic, ``Especially around 2015, many articles speculated on what the movie did and didn't get right`` followed by a few links.  `"

0,"`  I think I have a way to resolve this unfortunate Billy the Kid issue. If you will give me a moment, I first want to explain how we got to this point from my perspective. A lot has been made over my alleged failure to adhere to the preferred Wikipedia manual of style. That failure on my part is simply not being as well versed on the various Wikipedia guidelines as I probably should be. I am not trying to disrupt your standards. Indeed, I would appreciate any and all the help I can get, along with the active participation by experienced Wikipedia editors to bring the Billy the Kid article in line with Wikipedia standards.   I am not trying to defy or insult anyone. There seems to be a misunderstanding that suggests I seem to think that I have some kind of ``ownership`` over the subject of Billy the Kid. This is not true now - and it never was true. Perhaps some of this misunderstanding stems from a sentence I could have worded better which read as follows: ``All I was trying to do was provide the most accurate template on the subject of Billy the Kid that others could work from.``   If I could take back the word ``template`` I would, since it was clearly construed as meaning something totally different from what I was trying to state.  What I was trying to state comes down simply to accurate ``facts and dates`` regarding Billy the Kid, and bringing the state of those many ``facts and dates`` up to date to this point in time. Before it was removed, my Wikipedia article reflected the status of Billy the Kid research as it exists today. There were 147 detailed citations, which sourced the work of such noted Kid historians as Philip J. Rasch, Robert M. Utley and Frederick Nolan among many others. Before it was last removed on December 17, that version that I was working on contained the most accurate version of the Kid's life that has yet appeared on Wikipedia. That version of the article contained contributions by several researchers - not just me.  Then it all went away, when the article was removed for reasons that make no sense - at least not for anything contained in the article itself. I attempted to restore the version that I had been working on at 11:47 17 December 2015. I attached a note that read: ``Please do not delete this version of the Billy the Kid article. It contains the contributions of several respected historians, and remains the most comprehensive, and accurate treatment of the subject that has appeared on Wikipedia so far.``  My restoration only stayed up for 4 minutes and and was once again removed at 11:51 on 17 December 2015.  I made what turned out to be a final attempt at restoration six minutes later at 11:57 17 December 2015. This time I left a note that said ``The continued deletion of an article by myself, and several other contributors, goes beyond vandalism and borders on being criminal.`` The crime was against historical honesty, accuracy and, indeed, the goals that Wikipedia is supposed to stand for. The total lack of respect to those who contributed to the article goes without saying.  This time, for my troubles, I was blocked - and my blocked status remains in effect until Dec. 24. Merry Christmas.  The irony is that when the version of the article I last worked on was deleted,  on December 17, I was done with it. I had no plans for further changes. I had hoped that others would then jump in - particularly those who possess the Wikipedia editorial skills I lacked to make it go along with your manual of style and other Wikipedia preferences.  Billy the Kid, as you all know, was born in lower Manhattan in New York City. I would like to use New York City as an analogy for how I view Wikipedia. Since the early 1960's I've spent a considerable amount of time, off and on,  in New York City. Those of you who have been there frequently know that there is always construction going on. Indeed, change is a constant in New York City. Change is also a constant with any Wikipedia article. As stated, it was never my intention to ``own`` the article. I never expected, or wanted, it to remain frozen in place with my contributions. I was looking forward to contributions from other historians and researchers who could provide further info on the ``facts and dates`` contained in the article, as well as working with experienced Wikipedia editors who could correct any mistakes that didn't go along with your preferred ``encyclopedic`` standards.  Anyway, we seem to have ended up, at least for now, at cross purposes. Why it got to this point I don't understand. I am not looking for adversaries, at Wikipedia - I am looking for the collaboration of any and all who truly want to make the Billy the Kid article the best it can possibly be today - and, with the continued contributions of others, in the years that follow.  The quickest way to make this happen is by taking my last version of my article, incorporating whatever changes you feel are needed for that version, and, after doing that, restoring it to the Billy Kid page. You only have to look at the mess that is currently up there now and compare it to the version I, along with several others,  worked on to see that this is the right thing to do.  Many of you are probably familiar with the interview the founding father of Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales, gave to 60 minutes back on April 5, 2015. He wasn't referring to this specific situation, but he could have been when he said: ``Our biggest problem with bias, and things that stay for a long time are actually on very obscure topics. You know, a topic that not that many people are looking at. And so if something's wrong, it can persist for some time.``  Something is wrong here, and it shouldn't persist any longer. Christmas is almost here. Can we all take a deep breath, put our differences behind us, and agree to work together on the very best version possible of the Billy the Kid article? You know, Billy the Kid is not only one of the four or five most recognized names in Wild West History as well as a very familiar name in American History in general. People who know absolutely nothing about the Wild West have heard his name. Let us come together and give him the biography he deserves and stop this fight which no one wins. Thank you.   `"

0,"  == Sandbox proposal for Wikipedia: Belarusian geographical names ==  I just read  and I applaud you for undertaking this effort. However, while I appreciate the idea of using the romanization as used by the Belarusian government as the basis, the transliteration/transcription seems to be inconsistent between the various layers of government. That is, the website of the central government uses other romanizations than the websites of the regions. For instance, the website of Gomel Region uses Yelsk and Oktiabrskiy, while the website of the central government uses Elsk and Oktyabrskii. In addition, in your sandbox I find forms that are used on neither website. You write Svietlahorsk while both the central government website and the Gomel Region website use Svetlogorsk.  If this proposal is to have any chance of being adopted, I think it should as much as possible try to use the same source for most of its transcriptions. The central government website seems the most logical choice to me.  However, unfortunately, I cannot say that I am completely satisfied with the romanizations used by that website. Here's a few reasons why: * the transcription of iotation / palatalization is wildly inconsistent: :* in some names, iotation/palatalization is not marked: Elsk, Svetlogorsk; :* in others, iotation/palatalization is marked using the letter y: Oktyabrskii, Kostyukovka; :* in yet others, the letter i is used for the same purpose: Liozno; :* in still others, the letter j is employed: Marjina Gorka; :* sometimes, in one part of the word iotation/palatalization is marked, while it isn't in another part of the same word: Myadel (Cyrillic , pronounced ). * the ending  is inconsistently romanized. Compare Oktyabrskii and Pervomaiskiy (as a bonus, observe that the first i in Pervomaiskiy is a transcription of , which on the rest of the map is usually transcribed as y'').  Observing these inconsistencies, I am not convinced that using these romanizations is the solution. While BGN/PCGN may not be perfect, it is at least consistent. If this, this and this are the alternatives, I think we should stick to our existing policy of using BGN/PCGN. -   "

0,"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Nephilim deleted edit ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou state reliable sources. The first part of my edit is that which is taught in college (you would know if you ever attended). It is taught in literature class. It is: When studying this passage, or any passage of the Bible, it is best to use the Exegetical method, which is tearing it down to the bottom and rebuilding it using 6 contexts. First, one must use the Bible to interpret the Bible. Second, using the 6 contexts, which are: 1. What is the context (main idea, or thought) of the Bible?, 2. What is the context of the book you are reading (Genesis, Exodus, etc.)?, 3. What is the context of the chapter you are reading?, 4. What is the context of the verse you are reading? 5. What is the context of the key words?, and 6. What is the historical context? How did the people of that time think, act, etc. An example, to name something is to place one's authority on it. A king of a city state that has conquered another city state gives it a new name, because he is place his authority on it. Two things to keep in mind for a sound, correct interpretation of this passage are: 1. Where is the beginning of the narrative; the pivotal spot? It is Genesis 3:15, which is a prophecy of Christ and the beginning of the battle between evil and good. It is followed by the first example the story of Cain and Abel., 2. In the original Bible there were no chapter or verses, these were added later to make it easier to find passages. The story of the Flood begins at Genesis 4:17 and goes to Genesis 9:7 (this story should have been 1 chapter).NEWLINE_TOKENThis aids the scholar attempting to understand and interpret a difficult passage. NEWLINE_TOKENThe next part: Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-27-5, New Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson; Kregel Publications 1987, ISBN 0-8254-4030-0/ both page 185)renders the word nephilim meaning as to fall upon other in rapine violence and apostates fallen from true religion. Strong's Exhaustive Concordance Of The Bible Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary, James Strong (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-01-1) cites the word as a bully,tyrant, or dictator. NEWLINE_TOKENHere is given references to where the data is gotten (even page numbers), but by what you say this is reliable or acceptable. Just what would be.NEWLINE_TOKENThe next part: One can get copies of the First and Second Book of Enoch, which one can read. Two such books are The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Vol 1(Doubleday & Co. Inc., 1983 ISBN 0-385-09630-5)and The Other Bible(Harper & Row, Publishers ISBN 0-06-250031-7)and there others. A WARNING. When reading these books keep in mind that they are non-canonical and are considered fictional; not God inspired and truthful. When one reads the Book of Enoch one sees a measurement for the offspring as 300 cubits. A cubit is 18 inches (check any Bible dictionary), or 1 1/2 feet. As such the offspring is 450 feet tall.NEWLINE_TOKENThis again shows where one can find the data. All these references are from PUBLISHED and ESTAB_TOKENLISHED books, that is accepted by college professors, but not by you. How did the article get on Wikipedia? Did the author bribe someone, or is it that they are a dear buddy?NEWLINE_TOKENYou may think this harsh, and it may be, but it is deserved. The reason why the information has been verified with published authentic sources that you refuse to accept. Then what needs to take place is that the articles references must be rejected as well for they are based on the same method and material. Why accept one person's references and not an others when both are from published established sources available to the public.NEWLINE_TOKENOnce before I attempted this folly on an other article and again nothing, not even a police report, was accepted. The only thing I can think for this is that Wikipedia employees are not getting their palm greased, or that I am not a dear buddy with an in.NEWLINE_TOKENThe reliable verified referenced attainable data is beneficial and helpful to the reader and scholar, but you and Wikipedia don't care, and spit on me, my effort to help, and the ones who would have benefited from it. Now you cam laugh and do a dance for you wasted my time and you have robbed the reader."

(Since he is in many controversies, coverage of all of them could fill up several articles). The fact that he is a reporter for a publication, World Net Daily, that we do not consider a reliable source should theoretically deserve some weight. It seems possible that a recent participant on talk, 79.178.103.240, may be connected to Klein. My only evidence is the POV expressed and the geolocation of the IP.

0,"` September 2013 (UTC)  I love how I specifically tried in a polite manner to engage in meaningful dialogue here, and asked you to respond in a way to help me understand why you refuse to accept the submission.  Your 2-line response was the equivalent of ``nana-nana boo-boo,`` as far as I am concerned. Let's dissect these 2 lines.  ``::you don't understand propaganda.`` That is a loaded statement if I ever read one. I have read up on the term propaganda, thanks very much, and my readings are not simply limited to this website, which I feel is narrow in its scope. I have been on a program that toured the death camps of Poland and studied the use of propaganda in Nazi Germany. I am currently awaiting a response from a PhD who has lectured and studied the use of propraganda in the media/industry, and it is with respect to our point of contention here. Funny, I can't find any work you have done on this subject, Mr. Jensen, yet you seem to be trying to claim superior academic grounds here. I have made an attempt to engage in meaningful dialogue, and you response above clearly shows you cannot or will not make an effort to present factual arguments to prove such a comment.   ``You use the word to denounce advertising for products you consider harmful.`` I am not denouncing advertising for products I consider harmful, and this is what you need to understand, because I have stated this on multiple occasions in many different ways. This statement you have just made is a personal attack. Additionally, it is incorrect. I don't consider the product to be harmful. It is harmful. This is not an opinion, but a restating of facts by the IARC/WHO, and health organizations worldwide, based on the overwhelming body of evidence that is available. If it were simply an opinion, I can understand why you could be frustrated. But the irony, Mr. Jensen, is that the fact that you and others believe that this is simply an opinion is possibly the result of hearing or reading propaganda used by those in the tanning industry to cloud the picture. Tanning bed exposure is strongly associated with skin cancer, among other health risks (please take the time, I urge you, to read any or all of the references I quoted in my submission, all from established medical journals). The industry claims that these risks are not existent or are insignificant, says that UV exposure is more controlled in a tanning bed (not proven whatsoever), and claims health benefits of tanning bed use that are either unproven (e.g. cancer prevention, ``base tan``), exaggerated, and can be achieved through safer means (e.g. Vitamin D exposure).   So please enlighten me, Mr Jensen, as to what propaganda is? Is propaganda not ``a form of communication aimed towards influencing the attitude of the community toward some cause or position by presenting only one side of an argument?``. That's the definition on the wiki page, right? I am sure you have head of a systematic review - that is when an established researcher evaluates all of the evidence for and against an exposure, and concludes if the body of evidence favours a hypothesis. It is the most balanced and unbiased way to assess an intervention or exposure. Well, that's what I use, and that's what the World Health Organization used, when they came to an unbiased conclusion that UV exposure from tanning beds (as well as the sun) is a carcinogen, in the same class as cigarettes. In my submission, I think I clearly showed that there are many in the tanning industry and their associated organizations who have reported only the small studies that show their point of view, but neglect to mention the overwhelming amount of evidence that goes against their points, including the systematic reviews I mention. Is this not the same as ``presenting one side of an argument`` to ``influence the attitude of the community``? Or, is it that, as you say, I just ``don't understand propaganda``?   I have to say it yet again to you, because I think this is such an important point that I have to drive home - this is not my ``opinion``. 1) Tanning beds cause more harm than good, fact. 2) Tanning industry sites present the good (which is partly true) and negate the bad (partly false), and this is also a fact. If you can find me a tanning industry association that clearly presents a balanced view, you show it to me because this would run counter to the principle of ``good business`` - its impossible for an industry that causes harm to remove a conflict of interest when weighing evidence for or against their product, and the result is advertising that is propaganda. 3) The industry has used scapegoats/diversion tactics (e.g. suggesting that Cancer Society and Neutrogena are connected in an elaborate scheme to sell skin products through fear mongering, stating that the government is taking responsibility away from parents to make decisions on behalf of their children, blaming other tanning salons for unregulated exposure, etc.). If you put 1+2+3 together, I honestly don't know how you can tell me that me stating that this is propaganda is anything other than a fact.  ``I think your efforts at Wikipedia are in fact propaganda, an irony you need to appreciate.`` This is an easily reportable personal attack. I am an MD and a FRCPC, and I have no interest in engaging in my own propraganda. This would be against an ethical code that we as physicians subscribe to, and the suggestion that I am compromising such a code is both laughable and troubling to see by an editor of this site. Personally (please don't mistake this for propaganda), I don't think you should be editing this page any more if you are going to be resorting to personal attacks, rather than facts, to prove your case. Thank you for providing me with evidence to support my own case. You can try and continue the same tact you have employed, and you have every right to be mad at me for earlier aggressive tactics that I have used, but I would have expected more from you after you reported me for similar behaviour. Just because you have power to remove my posts does not make you correct, and I have still yet to hear a shred of evidence from you that refutes any of my original points. I hope that you try, and then we can engage in thoughtful dialogue rather than veiled attempts at name calling.   05:18, 12`"

0,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Italian ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHey Sajoch, if you can discuss things relaxed for a bit, I do have a question I'd like to ask a Ladin from Bolzano.  I always hear about the Italians coming and taking over.  But, can you explain to me who exactly are ``the Italians``?  As far as I know, Italian in the modern sense is simply a citizen of the Italian Republic.  Going back a few hundred years ago, I suppose people might say they are a people ``of Italy``, or the Italic peninsula.  But, I'd say that even to this day, many people in Italy don't refer to themselves as Italian first.  Aren't the people of Sicily, Sicilians?  The people of Napoli, Napolitani?  As far as I can tell, the ``Ladin`` are the people of the region we happen to call Trentino-Alto Adige, and also the Romansch speakers in Switzerland are speaking essentially the same (or a VERY similar) language.  It would make sense that this pocket of Europe has its own particular language, and a language which is old-Latin based.  So, when you say you are Ladin, and not Italian... to me that is no different from someone saying they are Sicilian, and not Italian.  Then that brings me back to my original question: who is actually Italian?  Isn't the Italian language the Tuscan language actually?  So are Italians actually the people from Tuscany?  I know that Trentino is said to be majority Italian, but the people there speak Italian in modern times because it is the national language.  They still speak their original dialects like Nones, Solardo, etc.. which are actually Ladin languages.  You know that, right?  So are the people in Trentino Ladin people, or have they transformed into Italians because the Italian Republic has a National Language?  I'm just throwing these questions out there, as someone interested in my own history.  I mentioned this once to noclador, ``who are the Italians?`` and all the discussion got me was him giving me the link to the Wikipedia page on Italians.  My guess is that some of the questions I was asking blurred the lines of a politics he would rather dream is black and white.  I'd like to see if you'd actually be interested to discuss this, as you are a fellow Ladin at least...`"

0,"`I think the following better captures the nature of the Investigations. The first two pargarphs have not been changed but the final three are completely different. Comments please.  Although the Tractatus is a major work, Wittgenstein is mostly studied today for the Philosophical Investigations (Philosophische Untersuchungen). In 1953, two years after Wittgenstein's death, the long-awaited book was published in two parts. Most of the 693 numbered paragraphs in Part I were ready for printing in 1946, but Wittgenstein withdrew the manuscript from the publisher. The shorter Part II was added by the editors, G.E.M. Anscombe and Rush Rhees. (Had Wittgenstein lived to complete the book himself, some of the remarks in Part II would likely have been incorporated into Part I, and the book would no longer have this bifurcated structure.) It is notoriously difficult to find consensus among interpreters of Wittgenstein's work, and this is particularly true of the Investigations. Very briefly, Wittgenstein asks the reader to think of language and its uses as sets of language-games within which the parts of language function and have meaning in order to resolve the problems of philosophy. This view of language represents what many consider a break from the Wittgenstein in the Tractatus and, hence, meaning as representation. In the carrying out of such an investigation, one of the most radical characteristics of the ``later`` Wittgenstein comes to light. The ``conventional`` view of philosophy's ``task``, perhaps coming to a head in Bertrand Russell, is that the philosopher's task is to solve the seemingly intractable problems of philosophy using logical analysis (for example, the problem of ``free will``, the relationship between ``mind`` and ``matter``, what is ``the good`` or ``the beautiful`` and so on). However, Wittgenstein argues that these ``problems`` are, in fact, ``bewitchments`` that arise from the philosophers' misuse of language. On Wittgenstein's account, language is woven into the fabric of life, and it is within this ordinary everyday context that language actually operates. Philosophical problems arise, on this account, when language is forced out of the everyday context that is its proper home, and is forced into a new, metaphysical, environment, where all the familiar and necessary landmarks have been deliberately removed. Removed for what appear to be sound philosophical reasons, but which are, for Wittgenstein, the very source of the problem. Wittgenstein describes this metaphysical environment as like being on frictionless ice; where the conditions are apparently perfect for a philosophically and logically perfect language (the language of the Tractatus), and where all philosophical problems can be solved without the confusing and muddying effects of everyday contexts; but where, just because of the lack of friction, language can in fact do no actual work at all. There is much talk in the Investigations, then, of “idle wheels,” and language being “on holiday”, all of which are used to express this same idea of what is lacking in philosophical contexts. To resolve the problems encountered there, Wittgenstein argues, philosophers must “bring words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use.” That is, philosophers must leave the frictionless ice and return to the “rough ground” of ordinary language in use.  Returning to the rough ground is, however, easier said than done. Philosophical problems having the character of depth, and running as deep as the forms of language and thought that have become habitual for the philosopher. Wittgenstein therefore speaks of “illusions” and “conjuring tricks” performed on our thinking by our forms of language and tries to break their spell by attending to differences between the superficially similar forms of expression that can lead to this type of confusion. For much of the Investigations, then, Wittgenstein tries to show how philosophers are led away from the ordinary world of language in use by misleading aspects of language itself. He does this by looking in turn at the development of various philosophical problems, from the general problem of language itself, through the notions of rules and rule following, and then on to some more specific problems in epistemology and philosophy of mind. Throughout these investigations, the style of writing is conversational with Wittgenstein in turn taking the role of the puzzled philosopher (on either or both sides of traditional philosophical debates), and that of the guide attempting to show the puzzled philosopher the way back: the “way out of the fly bottle.”   Much of the Investigations, then, consists of examples of how philosophical confusion is generated and how, by a close examination of the actual workings of everyday language, the first false steps towards philosophical puzzlement can be avoided. By avoiding these first false steps, philosophical problems themselves simp"

A ritual bath in the sacred Manasa Sarovar lake will deliver a pilgrim to Brahma's paradise and a drop drink of its water relinquishes the sins of hundred lifetimes."""" 

  
 “Harih Om - how was your trip to kailash”? This is a question often posed to me these days, after my return from the yatra on July 15, 2006. There is so much to say; but most people are looking for a short answer. So, I feel the right answer is: I am not sure how to verbalize an exalted experience of this nature, at the minimum it was a most memorable experience that simultaneously was very physically challenging, highly spiritual, emotionally elevating, intellectually inspiring and provided ample opportunities for solitude and closeness to GOD. “Om Namah Shivaya” – “mamepemehum” – Tibetan Holy mantra. To undertake a Yatra to Mt. Kailash, is to undertake a Yatra to your own divine self. The happiness and grace that a pilgrim can experience on such a trip are beyond words.

Secondly, she was born in Norway to an Afghan mother and a Pakistani father. This therefore doesn't make her Norwegian, however, the Jew media likes to make her out to be Norwegian/British. She's neither. Deeyah Khan is your typical racist, towards white people and is also one of the many deluded, non whites who actually believes that only white people can be racist. It is clear, above all else that her career is being funded by Jews. You don't get into media unless you're working for the Jews and her documentary on 'neo nazis' in Charlotsville (White Right: Meeting the Enemy) scooped many awards, all, broadly supported by Jewish owned by Jewish msm. And this is what angers me about people like Khan. She's clearly a racist and hates white people and I am deeply sad what has happened to Afghanistan, but either is she  completely ignorant on the fact that Jews were entirely responsible for the war against the Afghani people and pretty much own the Pakistani government, as they do most. As stated, her video was a demonization of white people, who love their culture and nation and this is precisely what the Jews love doing most - funding alien peoples, to make racist documentaries, whom they then classify as British, while showing these documentaries on  British telly, in order to make white people hate each other even more and of course to hate anyone who is opposed to white genocide, mass immigration and multiculturalism. Stupid people won't see what's going on, but then they never see what's going on, so no change there. However, for those who are awake and can see, it's what really makes them angry when they see how much the msm is lying and bringing civil war, creating division and promoting the destruction of 'whiteness' (white genocide). When the Scottish National party puts a Pakistani (Humza Yousaf) in the position of Cabinet Secretary for Justice, who then openly states that Scotland is 'too white' and that he wants to see more people of colour in the Scottish government and the Scottish msm says nothing, you know that you have a really, big problem."

 :Normally i contribute to topics in the sphere of religion and spirituality so this is a rather racy departure for me. Nevertheless i felt compelled to make a correction. Somebody had replaced the phrase 'vaginal massage' with 'genital massage' and this is incorrect. The medical treatment for hysteria over the centuries was not stimulation of the clitoris and vulva but what is today called the 'g-spot'. So, to be absolutely precise, the 'hysterical paroxysm' mentioned in the introduction is not merely a common or garden 'clitoral orgasm' but a 'g-spot orgasm' which is qualitatively different.

The Duggar family had a reality television show called \*19 Kids and Counting\*, which ended due to backlash when it was discovered that the oldest son molested four of the sisters.

As for the tag on the top of the article, that was placed by me.  I put it there because I think the article relies to heavily on press releases.  Generally, if information is not available from any source except through press releases, that information probably isn't appropriate for the article.  If independent sources are reporting on or commenting on such information then it may be notable enough to include in the article.

Whilst I do not agree with this method, and sometimes it can take several months after election day before candidates are officially sworn in, this is the way terms of office are recorded (at least in NSW & Victoria), and in several cases, dates of actual assumption of office do not appear to be available.

He first started his college coaching career at University of North Carolina as an assistant coach for Dean Smith in 1978. In 1988, Williams became the head coach of the men's basketball team at University of Kansas(link), where he took them to 14 consecutive NCAA tournaments, collecting an 80% win percentage, and winning 9 conference titles over his 15 year span at Kansas. In 2003, Williams left Kansas to go back home to be the head coach at North Carolina replacing Matt Doherty(link). While Williams has been at North Carolina he has won 6 ACC conference titles, 2 ACC Coach of the Year awards in 2006 and 2011.He is second all-time for most wins at Kansas behind Phog Allen and at North Carolina behind mentor Dean Smith. Additionally, he is eighth all-time in the NCAA for winning percentage.http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/m_basketball_RB/2014/Coaching2.pdf Williams has over 700 career wins and is the fastest to reach this milestone to date. Williams has taken his teams to seven Final Fours in his careers at Kansas and North Carolina and is one of only two coaches (along with Rick Pitino) in NCAA history to have led two different programs to at least three Final Fours each.  On April 4, 2005, Williams shed his title as ``the most successful coach to never have won an NCAA ring`` as his Tarheels defeated the University of Illinois in the 2005 NCAA championship game.(link) In 2007, Williams was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame.

0," :It sounds like AussieLegend also thinks we should use proper English in the credits.  I don't see anything about this in the manual of style or in the TV-specific guidelines at WikiProject Television.  This might be a matter that could be taken there to see if there's a consensus on what should be done.  I personally think we should go with what the episode credits say (using things like Jeffrey Lieber and J.J. Abrams & Damon Lindelof).  This way, we preserve the information about who worked together and who worked separately.  Since the information is in a table and not in the middle of a sentence, I see no reason to correct grammar here (and I'm usually really picky about grammar).  The best example that comes to mind is Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl where the credits list writers as Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio and Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert.  Clearly, the first two worked together, while the last two worked independently of the others.  I think that information is important and (if it were an episode of a TV series) should be listed as such in the episode table.  Whenever I type in writers, I always go with whatever the episode says (of course, from what I can remember, I've never dealt with an episode from more than two writers before).  Again, though, there is no statement anywhere in policy that I can find that specifies which format should be used.    "
