It's a really hot day here in the UK after a series of hot days and my mind is not working clearly. I'm not sure what you're asking me. I think you're talking about Category:Beverage companies, and how breweries end up there. At some point that has been organised thus - Category:Beverage companies - Category:Alcoholic beverage companies - Category:Beer and breweries by region - Category:Beer and breweries in North America - Category:Beer and breweries in the United States - Category:Beer and breweries in Alabama. The brewing companies are contained within each ``Beer and breweries in Foo`` cat. What you are proposing is the same thing as already exists, but separating the companies from the brands at a low level, and then having two cats - one of products and one of companies, running side by side up the tree. What I am saying is that is not needed and is unwanted. We'd like to keep the beer and the brewery together in the same multi-purpose cat. Beer and brewery are often related. Bass and Heneiken, for example, refer both to product and company. Where possible we deal with both product and company in the same article, though with notable examples we will split off the product into its own standalone article.

 == Army (Soviet Army) == 

 Hi Buckshot06, 

 I removed the request for the cite. I should have just brought it up here, and I don't care for the way that asking for a cite places an article into the """"unsourced statements"""" category, as if the article is asserting that unicorns have just taken power in Tanna Tuva. Sorry about that. 

 On the topic of the article, I think it is very valid.  The comments on the talk page miss the mark because army and corps structure, in WWII at least, were considerably different among the combatants, and considerably so when one considers the military organization of the USSR. A comparison of various high field command organizations might be a good topic for Wiki. 

 On this topic, one idea I've had for a while now is that the often-used comparison of a Soviet army to a western (or German) corps is at best tenuous.  There may be similarity in terms of manpower totals, but from what I can tell, the Soviet army seems to have the bulk of its troops in combat formations while a western corps has the bulk of its troops in the logistical """"tail"""". I'd be interested in your thoughts on this. 

 I was glad to see your article mention the return of the rifle corps as a command echelon, as many comment that the Red Army abandoned the use of rifle corps in 1941 and never re-instituted them.  I have to dig into the Soviet OOB someday and see precisely when they re-emerge, and I also suspect the armies not engaged against the Germans kept their rifle corps HQ throughout the war.

This would ensure maximum visibility if an article relating to South Carolina was submitted for deletion or promotion. #It would allow the South Carolina related articles to fall under the WPUS and South Carolina scope. #It would somewhat reduce the maintenance required by consolidating the templates #It would reduce the number of templates visibile on the articles #In addition to the above, I typically cycle through all the articles in the WPUS scope every month or 2 fixing various things (sections, typos, persondata, categories, etc) and this would allow the South Carolina articles to fall under that much more easily. Please let me know what thoughts or ideas you have about this and if the other members would be receptive to this. I also added a message to the talk page of WikiProject South Carolina.

Telly's belief that he's only ever slept with virgins is probably false (unless he slept with a virgin who had contracted HIV some other way) and so is Jenny's belief that Telly was her only partner, or that in a culture of random drugged-out sex and casual rape anybody can even be sure who they've slept with.

What do you call everything you do FeloniousMonk? That is, if it's not a political campaign on your part, what is? The POV campaigning I see here is a radical left-wing campaign on your part. My only goal is to bring things into balance here on Wikipedia because most outsiders regard it as highly unreliable and biased. Why don't readers have the right to know the type of group CRESP is ideologically speaking and who they associate with?

What's the problem with showing the political biases of groups you support, say compared with your baseless accusation that people like Paul Weyrich or James Dobson want to impose Old Testament law upon the United States? I thought that if something was factual and verifiable, it was kosher. That's what you told me about TheocracyWatch. If Paul's a theocrat, then maybe you could find a first-hand reference of the kind I provided. Are you not aware that United for Peace and Justice was founded by the Communist Party USA and a number of Marxist groups, and according  to the Commmunist Party USA Web site Joelle Fishman an officer of the CPUSA is a member of the steering committee? Tell me, why are you so worried about people knowing that CRESP belongs to an organization populated by the Ruckus Society, CodePink and the Communist Party USA?
The vast majority of the UNFPJ's members are pretty extreme on the Left side of the spectrum. The important thing about UNFPJ is who founded it.
For me to a belong to a group on the right akin to the UNFPJ, it would be akin to belonging to a group founded or run by the Nazis. Are you afraid of the truth?

Deal with the substance here, not my personality, or your efforts to railroad me with a phony RfC signed by your friends. Let's stop applying the rules differently when they make you uncomfortable. 

Why is it poisoning the well to point out the fact CRESP is involved with a pretty radical group? Are you afraid of the truth? NPOV doesn't mean just FeloniousMonk's point of view. I'm for balance, and diversity of opinions, expressed fairly is a good idea, don't you think?

TheocracyWatch can't prove it's claims, but I can prove these.
 
There's nothing for me to learn from the RfC except some people are afraid of having their worldviews challenged, or from being restrained from pressing their anti-religious political agendas. If you don't like my """"POV campaigning,"""" then why do you do it yourself? 

What do you call your series of hit pieces on the Christian Right about the supposed threat of """"Dominionism,"""" if it's not POV campaigning? Why is it every article you have posted on politics or religion expresses a Left of center POV? If I missed one, show me. I guess that's not POV campaigning, right?

Just in case you hadn't noticed, 49 of the 50 states say God is the ultimate authority, and it's spelled out in their constitutions.

How is expressing a more neutral perspective that is closer to the center of the political spectrum a threat to Wikipedia? What makes your POV superior to mine?  """

You appear to have posted this in the wrong location. I did not request a block removal. In fact, I had requested my user page and talk page be *removed*. Because there was an IP block, my guess is that it snagged someone or someones else.

In North America it is considered rude to suggest an action that you know someone cannot take. In this case, knowing that I was blocked, you knew that I could not """"let us know"""" anything, whoever """"us"""" is (is there someone in there with you?). Except insofar as you have office or authority in Wikipedia, no one cares about your personal assessments. In fulfilling your office or in exercising your authority, sharing your personal assessments is inappropriate.

In the United States in particular derogatory references to age, national origin, race, and religion violate both Federal and various state laws, are subject to civil action, and in some cases criminal action, and were I you I whould refrain from making them. You do not know me, my age or sex, and gross impertinence suggesting that I act some age or other is unwarranted. It was, in fact, a personal attack:

I've never ridden a bike in the US with the brakes reversed: On all, the right-hand brake controlled the rear brake. However, when I let people ride my bike in Tanzania, they almost inevitably crash the first time they use the brakes - they've never been on a bike with that configuration before. So here are two countries with different traffic directionalities corresponding to clear differences is brake setup. Now, nearly all Tanzanian bikes are made in China, as are a good number of US bikes (Schwinn, for example). So China must be selling right-rear bikes to the US, and left-rear bikes to Tanzania (or more likely East Africa).     "

They say they think they can change people from having homosexual attraction in way that minimise this, or even have heterosexual attraction.  The APA has said quite categorically that there is no evidence to support claims like these.  I don't see that people's delusions, even if they are experts, need a place in the lead of an article in which they only feature marginally.  They feature marginally, because the therapy is seen as fringe by the mainstream psychological and psychiatric communities.  The only people who take it seriously usually do so from a religious perspective, and the APA has also stated that religious interests have no expertise on these matters, and should stick to religion.  It is a fringe theory, because very few practitioners in this area hold it as having any merit, and there is no evidence to support it.

1,So true..I am caucasian and believe me I know many of these same people..some in my own fam damnly.

Which just plays into the hands of the mega richies like the Kochs who want us to either buy the crap they promulgate or give up like some people like Carlin. If we all felt this way we'd be saying Pres Romney (omg) right now. Thanks..I always post your vids to FB. Thanks much. I will try headphones. You are very enlightened and insightful. Thank you. EVERY SINGLE LIE he tells about 9/11 is disinfo. He will NEVER say outright that Bu$h and Israel had anything to do with 9/11..that's not what they pay him to do. People believe a guy who believes in reptillians..Jesus wept. Everything Jones spouts has been approved by his handlers in the CIA..disinfo. Jesus wept..where oh where will Exxon get their subsidies? Get a brain or quit replying to my posts. FO Female..not obvious from my comment? sorry: Jonestown.sdsu..go to link and go to McGeehee link The drink/injection mixture contained (I can't recall name of drug) the drug used in lethal injections and massive amounts of valium. They were drugging the people on a daily basis with Thorazine to keep them complacent and manageable. Everyone had to go to the 'clinic' (run by a family member of a Nazi doctor from Houston) daily for their 'vitamins'. Most of the ppl were shot Imo as they tried to escape/some by Guyanese govt police who did what the CIA told them to do. Jones was a communist like JP Morgan was..or Rockefeller. Jones spouted equality and communism but practiced the exact opposite. His inner circle at Jonestown was all caucasians..the black people were all slaves and money suppliers. Jones worked for the US CIA Jonestown was an experiment in mind control..see MKULTRA. The Temple had accrued mega millions that was hidden away in foreign bank accounts. Have you read NOTHING about this? Jones and Ventura both may have started out with good intentions but both sold out to the highest bidder. I consider both of them to be corporate shills. Zombies reptillians and Obama oh my. I see there's LOTS of PIGS commenting here..you're not fooling anyone with your 12 screen names PIGS. No decent HUMAN is not bothered by this atrocious brutality. Of course PIGS aren't human so that leaves them out. Hope it happens to you PIG'S mothers. Oh wait a minute you've probably all already killed your own mothers huh? It's much braver to be non-violent than to be violent (or something like that) Gandhi Thanks that's probably right. And hey! we hear this and yet the CIA is not help accountable..probably no fear cause they can lie and manipulate and kill witnesses and people who know too much so easily. Jones was about as much a Communist/socialist as JPMorgan was. Jonestown was a CIA experiment in mind control see MKULTRA; and Jones was a CIA asset long before he started the church/cult. In Jonestown the inner circle were all caucasians and the blacks were slaves..yeah communist right. He had amassed many millions of dollars in hidden foreign bank accounts..so again communism right. You need to become informed before you comment. Thanks for the info and great pictures. Amazing that it is still there. I never thought I'd hate anything like I do greedy heartless Republicans. Then the Tea Party boobs came along. Congress is now filled with these corporate puppets because even the smart Democrats and sane people think they only have to vote every 4 yrs. If the working class always voted and became informed we'd abolish the GOP and Tea Party in 2 years. Their goals are not to help the average person..just the 1%.

For example, if I write that the Dravidian culture of India is centered towards the Southern end of India, I generally won't document it, as it is already a well known fact amongst those who know about India.  Now if I were wrong about this in an article, then perhaps someone would first point out specifically that they have heard that the Dravidian culture is centered in the North of India, and could I please document my claim that it is centered in the South.  But simply to remove without even saying why, that doesn't seem to me to comply with general Wiki practice.

Utter nonsense showing exactly what is wrong with Wikipedia

This article reads like a press release, and uncritically accepts the claim that the CL is a """"civil rights"""" organization whose primary purpose is fighting """"bigotry"""", when in fact they attack anyone who criticizes any aspect of Catholicism no matter how politely or correctly, they actively proselytize for Catholicism as the one true religion, and their leader William Donohue, who is for all practical purposes their only member, has made numerous anti-Jewish statements. It is also a lie to say that the CL is a lay organization not controlled by the Church, when in fact their office is located within the Archdiocese of New York's headquarters and they work closely with the Archbishop to coordinate media strategies.

The NPOV and anti-libel policy on Wikipedia has become an """"accept anything everyone says without blinking an eye and don't criticize anyone on relevant grounds"""" policy because none of the editors here actually know anything about the subjects of the articles. If someone who was not a fifteen-year-old anime-watching idiot could actually become an administrator around here, maybe we could see an article on the Catholic League actually discuss what the Catholic League is known for in American politics. Instead, we get nonsense criticism sections telling us things like what PETA thinks of Beyonce Knowles, while anything of actual relevance to the world today is declawed for fear of """"offending"""" people who don't like the truth or for being sued for libel due to a poor understanding of the law.

 Bibliography Revamp with Serialisation 

I'm proposing a revamp of the Bibliography section including the addition of a second table dealing with the serialisations of the Hornblower novels.
The serialisations were actually the first publication of all the works except the first novel so I think they deserve the space.

Currently I've put my proposed new content up at User:Jaa101/sandbox.

With the main bibliography table the main change I'm proposing is to have separate columns for the US and UK titles which are so often different.
This frees up the comments column for other information.
I've also made both the dates of publication and dates of the stories more precise.

One worry I have with both my tables is that I've linked extensively and repeatedly in them.
Normally one would link only on the first occurrence but, in this case, the tables are sortable so what's first may change.
I think it's acceptable as it is.

Finally, I've added mention of the first and most important omnibus """"Captain Hornblower"""" and also the """"Cadet Editions"""".

I propose to change the main page based on feedback.

0,"No need to apologize.  My editorial comments are sometimes more curt or critical than they should be, and this quite naturally elicits a strong reaction.  

The problem of ground pressure was well-understood by the US Army Ordnance Dept. during WWII. I find it difficult to identify any direct relationship between the T-34's lower ground pressure, and efforts by the US Army Ordnance Dept. to achieve similar results.  In fact, designers of both tanks were simply reacting to the conditions imposed by the European battlefield, and the Russian's worked out the solution while the American's were still getting the M4 ready for battle in the sands of N. Africa. 

Keep in mind that the relatively few engagements involving T-34s and M4s were fought mostly at relatively close ranges.  This helped mask the penetration problems of the 76mm HVAP (It was only marginally better than the AP shot round.), and led to a generalized misunderstanding of the tank's effectiveness against its Russian counterpart. I have not heard of a 90mm Sherman seeing combat in Korea.  In answer to your question about who was responsible for sending us out in undergunned death traps, it was Lt. Gen. Leslie J. McNair.  A long time staffer, McNair was a genius at organization, but demonstrated very little understanding of, or for that matter, any willingness to learn about the actual effectiveness of our tanks and tank destroyers on the battlefield.  Had he died a year earlier, we would have gone ashore in Europe equipped with 250 T26 tanks and possibly even some 90mm Shermans.  It would have made a difference."

Thanks for notifying me of the RfM case about the Second Intifada. I'm not really involved in the case, although I have indeed participated in that particular discussion in the Second Intifada article by giving my 2 cents. For the record, I am not involved in any dispute with any of the editors in the case, and hold it as low priority. However, I will, again, give my 2 cents on the issue if necessary. On a side note, you might want to add the admin  (a.k.a.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Hi, thanks for notifying me about this too. To be honest I have no idea how the mediation process works or what I should or shouldn't do in respect of one, or how involved I actually want to get in mediation over one word.  I pretty much set out what my own views are on the article talk page, and others have provided more detailed sources for the debate. I don't see a problem with using this one word in the way it is currently used in the intro, and people objecting to it are simply wrong when they say that the word is inherently biased, or that the intro doesn't cover alternative points of view. Oh and I'm sure people will pick me up for saying this again, but some of those involved in the debate don't have English as a first language - I'm sorry but this is surely significant when debating this sort of issue.

Susan is the most frequent recurring character (in seasons 4 and 7) and Elaine is one of the main characters; the number of Susan's appearances is a matter of simple math, therefore not OR. I have had this type of confusion in the past and the solution seems to keep the phrase ``frequent recurring character`` instead of ``frequently recurring character``, or – we could settle for ``secondary character``.

It has now been moved into the biography section, which is perhaps a sensible place for it. But why should it not have its own frank sub-heading? Whether true or not, the ``controversy`` (not just a family one!) is clearly an important part of his biography and was splashed all over the national newspapers, but it is also a discrete topic in itself.     Taivo, you deleted my assertion that this allegation gained wide-spread publicity together with the quote from The Washington Post about the shocked LDS reaction, on the grounds that this was ``sensationalistic and not really necessary``. On the contrary, it is the very notoriety of these allegations that makes it inevitable for them to be included in the article. And the publicity and LDS reaction is an integral part of that story, given that he was an LDS scholar. Surely, it therefore is ``really necessary``. The allegation made by his daughter may be sensationalist (whether true or not), but my edit doesn't make it any more so. So I hope you will agree to re-revert. Or do you have any other suggestion?   `"

At the time of his discharge, it was his wishes and for the convenience of the Marines, according to the records. The Marines gave him an honorable discharge. Of course this is unverifiable even though I have all of the Marine Records, FBI records, Medical Records, Police Records, Texas Department of Public Safety Records, interviews with Whitman's professors, friends, victims and a few members who were in his Boy Scout Troop when he was a Scout Master in Austin. So I am not qualified to speak on Whitman in the article as the history on the article page will show.

0,"""As a matter of curiosity==

As a matter of curiosity, if a person with a Circumcision Fetish found his way to this article, would they be allowed to edit it as an authentic observer?  By the way, the circumcision in front of the grass hut on page 5 of the WHO pamphlet, """"Global Trends,"""" would indicate that the purported HIV protection targets village people who live in primitive conditions.  Would that also target the English-speaking readers of a wiki site like Wikipedia?  ...  Anyone ever hear of an educational foundation known as the Gilgal Fellows  perhaps an entry in this article could describe their work.    
Unfortunately it appears anyone may edit the article regardless of a conflict of interest.  I have also questioned the relevance and impact of third world African HIV studies on our modern audience to no avail.   

 Thanks for the link to a conflict of interest. Since there are a number of fellows who edit this article, it would be helpful to know if any of them have information about the Gilgal Fellows described here  It could be revelatory for Circumcision Wikipedia to include a section on the Gilgal Fellows, who apparently have quite a mission.  It's my understanding that GILGAL is an obscure word for MOUNTAIN OF BURNING FORESKINS.    

 No one having objected to the proposed sections on Circumcision Fetish and the Gilgal Fellows, I will assume a consensus, delegate the research, and get back here with it ASAP.    
It's impossible to assess such a vague proposal.  If you provide some specific, sourced content, we can assess its suitability.   

 """"...we can assess...""""  Now would that be the Royal We or you claim to speak for other fellows?   
""""We"""" refers to myself and others who may be interested in evaluating the proposal.   

 All the same, I don't get why YOU in particular deigned to represent the other fellows without asking their permission. It'll take a lot of Human resources to put these sections together... and if the """"consensus"""" is already fixed in advance, what's the point?   
Perhaps it's a little presumptuous, but it's realistic.  It's usually a safe bet that more than one person will comment on a proposed change; take a look at the archives if you want to confirm that for yourself.
As for your proposals, previous discussions have found that there are no reliable sources discussing a """"circumcision fetish""""; searching Google Scholar for """"Gilgal Society"""" indicates that there are no reliable, secondary sources regarding that subject either.  So I would think it doubtful that content could be written in a way that conforms to our policies.   

 """"Our"""" policies?... You mean the Gilgal Fellows?  I'm not certain WHO you're representing here.   
Wikipedia's policies, obviously.   

 Another reader deleted this interesting discussion for some reason.  In trying to improve the Circumcision article, it's important that we discern between authentic readers and those who are paid a salary to patrol and manage this article.  That's not a personal attack, nor a lack of presumption of good will.  It's merely being realistic about who finds their way to this controversial article, and a healthy cynicism about some readers' intransigence.  One reader has left a very rude & domineering comment on my user page.  If personal attacks like that are the norm, I can only assume that a number of fellows are paid to patrol this article, and its objectivity should be flagged on the title page.

0,`  again its you and  wiki rukes that don't get the message. bad behaviour is in not allowed. its inexcusable and leads to being told off; personal criticism is the correct way to treat  some one behaving badly; and wiki rules should not be protecting the guilty. Personal criticism is what is required. if you act arrogantly or like a lazy dictator then you deserved to be called  on it and told in no  uncertain terms. your response of the 23 april was pathetic. ``i know nothing of tennis expert's behaviour`` is totally neglience on your part. you should be very well aware of  the history of the feud between tennis expert and myself on rod laver. you have been aware of it since late feb 2008  . you should have invsetigated rod laver there and then; you were told where the dispute was. there's no excuses for not reading all the evidence ; it exists and is easily accessible. that's jour job if you  agree to be somesort of judge. As to me using blue flahes you can't be serious.  i know nothing of wiki fancy stuff; all i do is write sentances; nothing else; i use my keyboard like a typewriter. i might further add that the wiki complaints procedure is unintelligble and like all of wiki a labyrinth with countless dead ends.   your response to be correctly crticised was to act like a vindictative policeman. punish the man who has justifiably criticism him. that's what you did and that 's bad behaviour.. and you  and wiki rules should take your punishment in being roundly criticised. wiki rules are rubbish and have no place in public forums. I was not given a vote on wiki rules and i'm under no obligation to follow them. bad actions should lead to condenmation in  words  and if wiki is blocking it then wiki deserves to be flushed down the toilet  jeffreyneave 1 may 2008         `

And there seems to be another connection... the Gnostic-inspired Cathars, under their customs, from 1000's to the Albiginian Crusade, women were more or less equal, and in the Aquitaine author Alson Wise says women could inherit and hold property and administer them automoniously from their husbands estates well into the mid 1200's. Boulonge, where Baldwin I and II and ultimatly the entire Jerusalem line, is from also was a Cathar stronghold. I would not be surprised if that was a contributing factor to Baldwin II;s ease in designating Melisende his heir."

This page, scientific model, might be helpful.  There are only two options here, given the use of the human genome generalization: Either the human genome is the genetic material for all members of the species, Homo sapiensin which case, ``human genome`` is not an abstractionor it is an idealization that represents the human species as a single ideal representation of genetic material (i.e., a scientific model).  At any rate, you still have not provided any reference or authority for what you referred to as how ``human genome`` ``is formally defined`` (i.e., as ``actual genetic material``).

Whilst I understand the law report format of this kind of change, I wonder if wikipedia should use such styles, or whether it should be more accessible?

Not one United Air employee helped her even after seeing her in a wheelchair and looking very weak. She finally found out she had to stay overnight and no vouchers were given. They said they weren't required to do so.  I had to book her a hotel that was 40 minutes away and she had to go there by taxi and it was after midnight.  I HATE UNITED for treating her that way!!!

 Depression 

Hi George. I am so sorry to have done that to your Management of depression edits. I know how frustrating it can be to have detailed work deleted. 

Acupuncture
As I said in my edit summary, it is just too early for us to include the results of that study. We will have to wait until it has been subjected to independent appraisal and contextualised in a scholarly systematic review. It is a fairly bright line rule here that we don't use """"primary"""" sources to modify or challenge the findings of strong """"secondary"""" sources. The relevant guideline is WP:MEDRS.

Magnesium
Your summary of the systematic review looks sound, but it goes into too much detail for that overview article. Please consider creating Magnesium and depression or Depression and magnesium or similar (by clicking on one of those red links), and pointing readers of Management of depression#Magnesium to your more detailed summary by adding {{main|Magnesium and depression}} or {{main|Depression and magnesium}} under the section heading.
